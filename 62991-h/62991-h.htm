<p class="dropcap">The following chapters were first published
serially in <cite>The North American
Review</cite>, from November, 1922, to March,
1923. For their reappearance in this volume
I have made slight changes in them
all, and have inserted in the fourth chapter
a few paragraphs written for <cite>The
Bookman</cite> of July, 1922. The editors of
both magazines have my thanks for permission
to reprint.</p>

<p>The title of the book will disclose at
once the critical theory underlying these
essays; they are studies in the discipline
which literature imposes on those who cultivate
it as an art, and their doctrine is
that language as a medium of expression
has certain limitations which the writer
must respect, and that the psychology of
his audience limits him also in what he
may say, if he would gain a wide hearing
and keep it. To know what can be said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
in words, and what effect it will have on
your readers, is the inward art of writing,
much more important even than the management
of a sentence or the shaping of
a paragraph.</p>

<p>I write here of literature as an art.
Since I mean to exclude, as not art, many
books of undoubted importance and of
wide appeal, I must attempt at least to
defend a distinction that to certain readers
will seem arbitrary. A book may tell
us of a life we already know about, or of
a life we as yet do not know; the pleasure
it gives us will be of recognition or of
curiosity satisfied. Of course no books
fall absolutely into one or the other of
such extremes, but it is fairly accurate to
say that every successful book does give
us information, a new experience, or
brings back an old experience to recognize.
Though both kinds of books may be
equally well written, we are inclined to
ask only instruction from the one kind,
but permanent enjoyment from the other.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
One is a document in history or sociology,
in ethics or psychology; the other, as I
understand it, is a work of art. If our
country has not proved a favorable birth-place
for literary works of art, the reason
probably lies in our history rather than in
lack of able writers. Ours has always
been, and still is, an unknown land; the
reader of American works has primarily
been looking for information about America.
The early visitors from Europe wrote
us up for the enlightenment of their
friends at home, and since our world has
changed rapidly, we still write up ourselves,
for our own enlightenment. The
too brief flourishing of literature as an art
in New England was possible only because
life there for one moment in our
history was so stable that a considerable
body of readers had much experience in
common; having had their curiosity satisfied
as to their own life, they could recognize
it and reflect upon the literary portrait
of it. But the New England moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
in our literature proved an exception,
and we are so accustomed now to read
novels and poems, not as art, but as bulletins
of information from the west, the
northwest, the middle west or the south,
that we are losing the sense of living art
in the New England writers themselves,
and are considering them more and more
as documents in a past civilization. Since
we have so great need of documents, I
realize that I prejudice myself with many
readers when I say that my chief interest
is in literature as art—in the books which
reflect the unchanging aspects of human
experience, rather than in the reports of
our temporary condition.</p>

<p>If literature in our country has suffered
from our passion for information, I believe
it has also been damaged in our day
by a bad philosophy of esthetics which has
encouraged the writer to think much of
himself and little of his audience. Literature
is an art of expression, we say in the
old phrase, and it expresses life. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
whose life? The writer’s, of course, replies
the philosophy I happen not to like.
No; if a book ever becomes famous, it is
because it expresses the experience of the
reader. The writer’s personality will pervade
it, but we must be able to recognize
ourselves in it before we can admit that
it portrays life truly.</p>

<p>The function of criticism, as I understand
it, is to discover, in the past experience
of the race, what books have won a
secure place in men’s affections, and to
find out if possible why men have been
permanently fond of them. A great critic
would be a scientist, observing the behavior
of the reader in the presence of certain
stories or poems, and recording the
kind of effect produced by various arrangements
of character and plot, or by
different employments of language. Such
a critic was Aristotle in the <cite>Poetics</cite>. The
art of literature has never had an observer
more accurate or more penetrating,
and those who return constantly to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
wise pages will understand why I have
quoted him so often, and often have drawn
upon him for aid when I have not used
his name.</p>

<p>I must record my gratitude to two living
philosophers also, towers of strength
to those of us who love books as works of
art—George Santayana and Frederick J.
E. Woodbridge. The first has taught me
through his books—are any books more
beautiful than his written in English today?
The second has enriched me with
his daily companionship and with those
spoken words, grave or gay but always
wise, which his friends and disciples learn
to save up for remembrance.</p>

<p>And I have offered this book in my
dedication to our one poet-critic in
America who has spent his genius in the
service of literature as art, and as art
alone. I do not know whether what I have
written will be altogether acceptable to
him, and if I put his honored name in
the forefront of my pages, it is not to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
shield me from deserved criticism. But
writing on this theme, I must bear witness
to his leadership among all in this country
who in my lifetime have known how to
prize the immortal things in great books—imagination,
ideal humanity, beauty,
and the kind of truth that is beauty. In
a day when literary criticism has been
contentious and personal, more like a political
campaign in a tough ward than anything
that Spenser or Sidney or Shelley
would recognize as a pilgrimage to wisdom,
Mr. Woodberry has written nothing
ungenerous or harsh of new arrivals less
scholarly, less gifted, less accomplished
and less chivalrous than himself. He has</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Let the younger and unskilled go by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To win his honour and to make his name.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Indeed, more than anyone else among us,
he has kept his faith that youth, given
time enough, will discover art as it will
find out other incarnations of beauty, and
will achieve new miracles in its worship.
Twenty-five years ago he taught us to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
love the masters in poetry—no easier thing
to do for boys then than it is now. We
have still to acquire his hospitality toward
the future, to look on with his good humor
and sympathy while the immature in the
world of art, as elsewhere, try to rearrange
the universe, not knowing that it
has been here for some time and is set in
its ways.</p>

<span class="smaller">DECENCY IN LITERATURE</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The quarrel with indecent art is an
old one, and the present discussion
of improper books, with threats of censorship,
begins to rally itself in two familiar
camps—on one side the moralists,
showing in the heat of debate less understanding
of art than they probably have,
and on the other side the writers, showing
in the same heat somewhat less concern
for morals than it is to be hoped they feel.
The censorious seem disposed to suppress
on the ground of indecency almost any
kind of book they happen not to like; the
writers seem at times to argue that all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
books are equally good, or, at least, should
be free and equal. These are the old exaggerations
of the quarrel. Yet in two
important respects the present discussion
is quite novel and more than usually interesting;
for one thing, the attack now is
less on obscenity, about which there are
no two opinions, than on indecency, of
which we have at the moment no adequate
definition; for another thing, the writers
themselves, perhaps for the first time in
history, have no definition of literary decency
to offer, and seem not greatly interested
in forming one.</p>

<p>Censorships are usually exercised for
the protection of religious or political
doctrine, and whatever may be said
against the method, at least in the field of
religion or politics the censor knows
clearly what he wishes to protect. But if
we now would protect decency, we must
first define the term. It is not enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
have a moral conviction on the subject;
we must have also some principle outside
of our emotional prejudices, based on
something more lasting than fashion. In
the present welter of contradictions and
opprobrium it is sometimes thought indecent
to wear bobbed hair or short skirts;
for the morals of the school, teachers have
been dismissed who rolled their stockings
below the knee. Obviously, these are not
great faults in decency, if faults at all; a
good deal of camel must have been swallowed
before justice could be done to
these gnats. Some of our neighbors wish
to suppress certain plays; others wish to
suppress the theatre. Some wish to suppress
Swinburne and Baudelaire, with
one hand as it were, while distributing
with the other copies of the Bible containing
the <cite>Song of Songs</cite>. A minister of this
type, earnest in his work for decency and
quite muddled as to what it is, told me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
that he could not give his approval to the
<cite>Spoon River Anthology</cite>, brilliant though
it was; he could approve of no book that
portrayed fornication. Yet he must have
read the story of Lot’s daughters and
their behavior with their father. He approved
of the Bible, and he would probably
not call it indecent. What is decency,
then, or its opposite?</p>

<p>At this point the writers ought to stand
up and answer. In other ages they would
have done so; they would have thought no
one so competent as the artist to define
decency in his own field, and they would
have stated their definition from the point
of view of art. They would have called it
“decorum” instead of “decency”, but they
would have meant the same thing—fitness
or propriety in the particular art they
practised. When Milton made his famous
plea on ethical grounds for freedom of the
press, he went on, as an artist, to say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
of course there are good and bad books,
and when a book has had its chance, it
must submit to the judgment of the competent.
He was writing in an age when
the reader might be expected to have some
training in artistic definitions of decorum.
If books are to enjoy freedom of publication
now, it seems incumbent upon the
writers to define the decency of their art,
and to spread the knowledge of the definition,
as widely as possible, that the competent
reader of today may have a standard
by which to judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It ought to be possible now, as it once
was, to define decency in terms outside
our emotions, not variable with our private
taste but fixed in the conditions of
the artist’s work. When man is inspired
by the world he sees to make some lasting
record of his feeling about it, and selects
a medium to express himself in,—wood,
stone, metal, color, language,—he immediately
encounters certain problems and
difficulties in his medium, certain limitations
in it which he must submit to, if he
would convey his meaning with precision.
The limitations of his medium, therefore,
dictate to the artist his first lessons in decorum.
For if you will not respect those
limitations, you will find yourself saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
what you did not intend; instead of
beauty, you will convey some effect humorous
or grotesque or ugly. It is at least
bearable to see actual garments on the
wax figures in shop-windows; we dress up
dolls. But not even the shop window
could tolerate a marble statue with clothes
on. When the artist learns that some
things, though excellent in themselves, do
not come out in his medium with the effect
he desires, his good sense and the sincerity
of his art compel him to leave these subjects
for other mediums. The themes he
thus abandons are not indecent in the
sense of obscenity or filth, not bad in
themselves, but they do not fit his art—or,
as writers used to say, do not belong to
its decorum.</p>

<p>The decorum of art may seem to the
moralist far less important than the decency
his own strong emotions feel after,
but the moralist is wrong. The decorum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
of art is the deeper kind of decency, for it
is based on lasting principles, and it leads
to an understanding of the positive good
in art, to beauty, as the moralist’s concern
for decency often does not. You cannot
explain on moral grounds why the glorification
of the body in Walt Whitman, let
us say, is sometimes disconcerting, yet the
glorification of it in Greek sculpture
seems not only decent but noble. The
artist could explain the matter if he understood
the decorum of artistic mediums.
In so far as he does not understand it, he
adds to the confusion of the arts in our
time; he fills our magazines, for example,
with photographs of Greek dances, and is
himself, let us hope, disturbed by the grotesque
contortions he has perpetuated.
The dance was probably a graceful flow
of motion; of all that flow, however, only
a few moments would be in the decorum
of the camera—moments of poise, in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
motion might be suggested but not represented.
But the photographer was
charmed by the moments of motion, which
are the essence of dance decorum, and he
gives us a picture of grim-faced ladies
suspended in the air, with frantic gestures
of fingers and toes.</p>

<p>In literature, since the medium is language,
decorum is a question of the limitations
and capacities of words. The
great limitation of language is that it
must be heard or read one word at a time,
though most of the things we wish to
speak of in this world should be thought
of or seen all at once, and their true outline
and their total effect may be dislocated
by piecemeal expression. To represent
in language a landscape or a person,
a building or any intellectual architecture,
is, strictly speaking, impossible; we can
merely make statements, carefully selected,
about the subject, and trust that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
no matter how dismembered in the telling,
it will somehow come together again in
the hearer’s mind, thanks largely to the
hearer’s imagination. Where the suggestion
is so slight and the collaboration so
great, the writer is under some obligation
to be precise and conscientious in what he
suggests. His responsibility might perhaps
seem less when he is telling a story;
if language is inapt for the portrayal of
stationary things having mass, structure
and extent, we might suppose it better
fitted to the representation of action,
which like language occurs in sequence of
time. But even in the recital of events,
language has to name separately in an artificial
order events which actually coincide,
and the reader’s imagination must
put the fragments together again. <i>“Indeed,”
replied Mr. Jones</i>, or, <i>Mr. Jones
replied, “Indeed!”</i> Neither formula quite
represents what happened. In life, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
we heard the “Indeed!” the sound would
tell us not only what was said but also who
said it. No wonder the poets have so
often thought of the drama as the most
satisfying literary form, for when a play
is acted, words convey in it all that they
can convey in life, and they are aided, as
in life, by other kinds of language—by
gesture, facial expression, scenery, which
speak to the eye while the voice is speaking
to the ear.</p>

<p>Because words must be spoken one
after another, there are not only some
things which are hard to say in that medium,
but others which in certain circumstances
should not be said at all. No
matter how much we select the sounds,
our utterance will lay a fairly even emphasis
on all the things we name; therefore,
if we wish to subordinate some part
of the picture, to pass over it with no emphasis
at all, we cannot throw it into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
shadow, as a painter can—we must leave
it out altogether. A painter may portray
a face half in shadow, so that one ear is
barely discernible; looking at the picture
you do not see the shadowed ear, and do
not miss it. But if some one tells you in
words that the ear is in shadow, at once
the ear enjoys special emphasis, the opposite
of the painter’s intention. Or suppose
the portrait is not shadowed, but all
the features are clear; and suppose the
artist has focused your attention on the
eyes, or has brought out some characteristic
expression. You can attend to the
picture exactly as you look at the subject
in life—noticing what is important in it,
but not examining it otherwise in detail.
The head has two ears, but you do not
count them. If, however, the writer describes
the face as it is in life, or as it is in
the portrait, he may speak only of the
chief focus or expression of it; he must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
not say that the subject has two ears. If
he does so, he will be indecent in his art,
and may seem to the original of the portrait
insulting in his manners.</p>

<p>All literary accounts of the human
body raise this problem, not a problem of
squeamishness or puritanism, but of decorum.
The classical Greeks seem to
have mastered the question either by instinctive
good taste or by analysis, as they
mastered so many other problems in art
with which we are only beginning to
wrestle. They cannot be accused of
prudishness where the body is concerned;
they loved its naked beauty, and in their
sculpture they portrayed it frankly, with
a serious and unflagging delight. Yet in
their poetry they did not portray it; they
merely noted the total effect of physical
beauty, and omitted details, as we should
omit the number of ears in the portrait.
In the classical Homer, to be sure, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
remained even after much expurgating
certain stereotyped labels of the body;
goddesses are “ox-eyed”, beautiful women
are “deep-bosomed.” But the phrases are
so conventional that they probably called
up a general sense of approval, rather
than a specific detail, as the word “mortals”
calls up to us the general idea of
men, rather than the fact of death. Aside
from such phrases Homer and the other
classical poets suggest the body without
detail, trying to render the general effect
the body makes in life—its femininity, its
masculinity—at the same time avoiding
any such attention to anatomical detail as
in real life would seem, to the Greek and
to us, morbid or clinical. The sculptor,
working in another medium, can use the
details the poet must omit; when we look
at his Apollo or his Aphrodite we see not
a naked body but a divine presence. The
effect of divinity is not furnished by any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
anatomical member, nor interfered with
by any. The body in detail is before us,
but the expression, the something divine
we feel, is in the attitude or the character.
The wise poet, knowing the limitations
and dangers of his medium, tries to reproduce
only the attitude or the character.
Later sculptors, in the decadence that
followed the Periclean age, deserted the
decorum of their own medium, and called
attention to separate parts of the body—to
ribs or veins, neck or breasts. In literature
a parallel decadence occurred; the
poets tried to give the effect of beauty, not
in Homer’s way, by avoiding physical detail,
but by citing it. They managed to
suggest not beauty but sex.</p>

<p>The modern lover of beauty who quite
properly wishes to restore the body to its
rightful honor and reverence, usually appeals
to the Greeks for his precedent.
But if he wishes to celebrate the body in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
detail, he should appeal not to the Greeks
but to the poets of the Renaissance. The
praise of the body in the Renaissance is
sometimes explained as springing from a
newly recovered delight in material
beauty. It should also be explained as a
reaction, on the part of earnest, even puritanical
moralists, against other moralists
who, they thought, viewed life but partially
and cramped the human soul. In
our own language, Edmund Spenser and
John Milton led in this praise of beauty—moralists
both; as in modern times Walt
Whitman led the praise, a moralist also,
whether or not his detractors admit it.
But a moral purpose is a dangerous approach
to art, whether you are a critic or
a poet. Whitman is perhaps the easiest
illustration to begin with. He felt that
to the pure every part of the body is
sacred, and at its best is a thing of beauty.
Had he been a sculptor, he would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
proceeded to make statues which probably
would have shocked nobody. Working in
language, however, he mistook the decorum
of the art, and wrote as though he
were sculptor or painter, and the result is
in those anatomical catalogues from which
no beauty emerges, whatever else does.
He differs as widely as possible from
Edmund Spenser in most things, but in
this one matter they are alike. Milton was
too close to the Greeks to go wrong, even
with his moral impulse to assert the honor
of the body; his impassioned praise of
wedded love, and his remarks on the glory
of nakedness when Adam and Eve first
appear in his epic, put no strain on literary
decorum. But Spenser’s moral enthusiasm
for beauty leads to such physical
inventories as his picture of Belphœbe, in
the second book of the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>, or
of his own bride, in the <cite>Amoretti</cite> and the
<cite>Epithalamium</cite>—an accounting of eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
teeth, hair, neck, shoulders, breasts, waist,
arms and legs. Many a critic has suggested
that his poems have the character
of painting or of tapestry, and had he
actually worked in a pictorial medium, he
would have made the effect he desired. In
his portrait of Serena naked among the
savages, in the sixth book of the <cite>Faerie
Queene</cite>, he followed Homer’s method with
admirable success. No English poet is
more spiritual than he—all the more impressive
the indecorum to which his moral
earnestness occasionally brought him, and
all the more helpful his example ought to
be to modern beauty-lovers who fancy
that the decorum of an art need not be
studied and obeyed.</p>

<p>Through ignorance of decorum in language
a moralist sometimes comes to grief
in the opposite direction; wishing to indicate
indecency, he sometimes through reticence
stumbles upon the Homeric method<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and portrays beauty instead. A while ago
a minister of some name, an aggressive
defender of decency, preached a sermon
on the dangers which at the moment he
saw threatening us from the arts. According
to the newspapers, he said that if
certain theatrical managers could get it
by the police, we should have a show in
which a naked woman in one scene posed
before a black velvet curtain. Wishing to
touch the sulphurous subject as gingerly
as possible, he merely suggested the lovely
contrast of body and background; those
of his congregation who had seen it forgot
their moral danger and remembered the
Venus de Milo in the Louvre. It occurred
to some of them that this material might
be indecorous in the pulpit; in the theatre,
however—well, they were not unwilling
to see it, if it was actually put on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The principle of literary decorum
which applies to the representation of the
body applies also to the allied theme of
sex. The body is a fit subject for literature,
but not in detail. Sex is a proper
subject for literature, so long as it is represented
as a general force in life, and
particular instances of it are decent so
long as they illustrate that general force
and turn our minds to it; but sexual actions
are indecent when they cease to illustrate
the general fact of sex, and are
studied for their own sake; like the ears
in the portrait, they then assume an emphasis
they do not deserve. This seems to
be the decorum of the theme as great writers
have treated it, and this is the decorum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
which men instinctively adopt in discussion,
if they have not been trained to think
that all discussion of sex is naughty.
People so trained will call any book indecent
which in any way touches the theme.
When <cite>Trilby</cite> appeared years ago, many
of us then youngsters were protected (in
vain) from the lovely story because Trilby
had been somebody’s mistress before the
romance began. So to an earlier generation
<cite>The Scarlet Letter</cite> had seemed dangerous
because Hester Prynne’s child was
illegitimate. But neither book had physical
passion for its theme, though the force
of sex in life, for good or evil, gave each
story most of its interest and its pathos.
How indecent in the artistic sense, how
indecorous, either book might have been,
we realize by supposing that Du Maurier
had centred attention on Trilby’s early
and sordid affairs, before she met her true
love, or that Hawthorne had given us in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
detail the experiences of Hester in Arthur
Dimmesdale’s arms. One has an uneasy
feeling that so the books might have
been written today; the general fact of
sex and its influence would not operate as
a colossal force in the story, but would be
deduced in an argument or assumed as an
hypothesis—modern specialists in sex are
so uncertain of its existence—and the
focus would have been on the animal
behavior of human beings, which the
hypothesis of sex would explain. This
kind of book is indecent, though it is usually
too psychological in manner to disturb
the censorious, and entirely too frequent
in recent literature to suppress.</p>

<p>We turn for relief to the decorum of
great literature. “From the roof David
saw a woman washing herself, and the
woman was very beautiful to look upon.”
The painter might give the details of that
beauty; the writer could not. But he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
could continue: “And David sent and inquired
after the woman. And one said,
Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of
Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
And David sent messengers and took her,
and she came in unto him, and he lay with
her; and she returned unto her house.
And the woman conceived, and sent and
told David, and said, I am with child.
And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me
Uriah the Hittite.” So begins one of the
greatest of stories from both points of
view, artistic and moral. Is it too frank
for our taste? Would the minister who
described so well the naked woman and
the black velvet, set this story also before
his congregation? He ought to, for it is
a masterpiece of decency. David’s passion,
Bathsheba’s acceptance of it and her
consequent terror, were important only as
beginning the spiritual tragedy; the old
writer names the facts and passes on to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
his great subject. To have begun less
frankly would have been to misrepresent
life and spoil the moral; to have elaborated
the scene of David’s love-making
would have been indecent. In the same
decorum the classical Greeks told their
stories; Helen eloped with Paris; Œdipus
had children by his own mother; Clytemnestra
killed her husband and made her
lover king—so much of the fact is necessary
in each case to understand the magnificent
and tragic consequences; but the
Greek poets did not pry further into the
details of passion.</p>

<p>There are, of course, unhealthy minds
which have developed a mania for
obscenity, and at the other extreme of
exaggeration there are the unbalanced
minds which do not care to admit the existence
of sex. But sex, in one form or
another, is in the thoughts of most people
most of the time, and common folk—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the great poets—speak of it constantly,
and in the same way. In unsophisticated
society, among sincere and simple men,
the references to sex are at once reticent
and frank; it is recognized and respected
as gravitation might be or as the sea is by
sailors—as a power always immanent, in
contact with which men may be lost or
saved. Gossip in that kind of society may
whisper that such a girl had a child by
such a boy only a month after their wedding,
or that so and so is not really the son
of his supposed father. Exactly this kind
of scandal furnishes material to Homer
and to the old prophets in the Bible, to
Dante and to Shakespeare, for sex is one
of the permanent sides of our moral
world. If this treatment of it is essential
to a complete picture of life, the thinness
of American literature may well come
from lack of frankness; but current attempts
to correct the thinness by dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
on physical details are seeking frankness
in the wrong direction and are but so
many offenses against literary decorum.
One reason why we cling with such pride
to <cite>The Scarlet Letter</cite> is that with all its
shortcomings as a novel it bases its great
moral vision on just such a complete and
decent observation of life as our books do
not usually give us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In this discussion of sex our attention
has shifted from the problem of language
to the question of the general and the particular
in art—that is, from the principle
of decorum involving the medium of literature
to the principle of decorum involving
its subject-matter. This second principle,
rightly understood, marks the chief
difference between contemporary art and
what some of us still believe was the great
art of the world hitherto—the best of the
Greek, the best of the medieval. When
you look at life naturally, in the directions
dictated by your spontaneous impulses,
it is your own life that seems important,
your private fortunes, your personal ambitions.
Everything that belongs to you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
seems peculiar, because it is not natural
at first to compare the lives of others with
our own. A poet who presents experience
from this angle of individuality will always
make a strong initial appeal and
perhaps a lasting one, since he falls in with
our instincts, and this accord will seem to
us evidence of something profound. Such
a poet, to some extent, was Euripides, who
imagined his characters sympathetically
from their private points of view, and portrayed
for us the egotism of human nature
in its most tragic form. It is not fair to
say that in his world men and women need
only to explain themselves in order to be
right; but, at least, after they have explained
themselves it is hard to tell who
are right and who are wrong. Such another
poet is Browning, who represents
human nature one individual at a time, always
from the individual’s point of view.
By such a simple and primitive method<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
he obtains effects of obvious richness—he
shows how varied life is, since there are so
many individuals in it, and how novel it
perpetually must be, since each of us is
discovering the world for the first time,
and how much right there is in every man’s
cause, once he has the chance to speak for
himself. If we had all the works of
Euripides, we should probably find in
them as rich and varied a world as Browning’s,
expressed with clearer and more
direct poetic genius. Our contemporary
taste is rather solidly for this kind of literature—Browning
flourishes more and
more, and Euripides has been revived;
and if you really approve of the individualistic
approach to art, it is hard to see
how you can call anything indecent. Anything
that is natural to any kind of character
must get a hearing.</p>

<p>But men can also be imaginative enough
to look at life as a whole—first, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
to look out at all other men, and then to
stand off and look at all men, oneself included.
When you begin to take an interest
in other men, you notice of course
that their lives are not like yours, not so
important nor interesting nor promising,
but in their drabness they are all curiously
alike; they all, with slight variation,
are born, are brought up, fall in love according
to their lights, marry, earn their
living, have children, grow old, and die.
When this uniformity begins to interest
you, you are making your first intelligent
acquaintance with life; and when you
have looked at mankind and included
yourself in the picture, when you have
admitted however reluctantly that the
single addition does not change the total
effect, that life is still simple and uniform
and that you are less peculiar than you
thought—then you have seen yourself at
last as one of the human race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>To see this calls for imagination and
for the Greek virtue which we translate
as magnanimity—great-mindedness. The
virtue is not to be acquired all at once.
We have made a great advance when we
can think of life in terms not of ourselves
but of moral and material aspects and
powers—in terms of youth and age, for
example, of strength or beauty or pride.
This is the allegorical stage of our pilgrimage
in wisdom, no mean stage to
reach, though it happens to be out of
fashion just now. We are acquainted
with it in the old morality plays, especially
in the almost popular <cite>Everyman</cite>, and perhaps
in Æschylus, especially in <cite>Prometheus
Bound</cite>.</p>

<p>But our advance is greatest when we
can recognize these aspects and powers in
the individuals around us—when our observation
includes at one and the same
time the general truths of life and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
particular instances. The poet preëminently
master of this sane wisdom was
Sophocles, who, in Arnold’s familiar
phrase, saw life steadily and saw it whole.
The point of view which he represented is
the most magnanimous, the least egotistical,
that art has yet taken, and one would
have to think meanly of the race to believe
that we shall not return to it, as to
the noblest part of the Greek legacy. But
Sophocles was only the illustration of a
decorum generally practised. In the brief
and magnificent period which left us our
greatest perfection in the arts, the Athenians
thought of the individual as important
if he illustrated for the moment the
general truths or fortunes of life, but his
strictly private fate was insignificant.</p>

<p>This attitude has been explained by
saying that the Greeks, having no gift for
introspection, took always an objective
view of life, but such a formula hardly accounts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
for all the illustrations of magnanimity.
When Athens was in her glory,
for example, it was only the public buildings
that were glorious; no individual, not
even Pericles himself, thought of putting
Phidias to decorate his private home.
Again, in the <cite>Antigone</cite> Sophocles is introspective
enough—as introspective as
Euripides or Ibsen himself—but the introspection
is concerned with the general
theme of piety, of one’s duty to blood relations,
not at all with the love story of
Antigone. She was betrothed to the son
of the king who condemned her to death,
and the fact proves tragic for the son and
for the king, but the love of the two young
people is their private business, and the
poet therefore does not let his heroine discuss
the problem of piety from that point
of view.</p>

<p>It was the genius of Shakespeare and
of Molière, even in comedy, to preserve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the same decorum. They show us those
aspects of man’s fortune which are of interest
to all men; of course we are free to
fill in the gaps according to our taste in
gossip, but the dramatist awakens our
feelings and calls our attention only to
general experiences and common wisdom.
In Shakespeare, <cite>Measure for Measure</cite> is
a good example, a noble tragedy and a
decent play. It is less glorious than the
<cite>Antigone</cite>, obviously, since it shows human
nature resisting temptation rather than
establishing an ideal, but the grimness of
its subject and the fact that it portrays an
indecent character do not make it indecent,
as some critics think. Its power is its
probing into general truths of life, chiefly
into the capriciousness of temptation
where sex is concerned, and into the various
forms of the fear of death.</p>

<p>Claudio, condemned to die and convinced
that there is no hope, persuades<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
himself that he does not care to live; but
immediately he has a chance to live at the
cost of his sister’s honor, and he finds himself
slipping into casuistry to make his escape
possible even on such terms. Here
is introspection of the Sophoclean sort,
touching the psychology not of a particular
man but of all of us. Walter Pater
remarked the paradox that Angelo is
tempted to his fall by sight of the pure-minded
Isabella, the incarnation of virtue.
He might have named other paradoxes of
Isabella’s influence. She fascinates all the
men she meets, good or bad. At the end
of the play the Duke announces that he
intends to marry her himself, and since he
gives her little opportunity to dispute this
plan, we may speculate how far his motives
differ essentially from Angelo’s.
But Lucio, the wretch so steeped by habit
in indecency that he can hardly frame a
clean sentence, is immediately and permanently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
sensitive to Isabella’s beauty of
soul as well as of body. Why? Shakespeare
merely exhibits the paradox, in his
characteristic way, without hint of explanation.
But we may read a lesson in
decorum, if we wish, in the decency of art,
from the first speech of Lucio to Isabella
in the nunnery, when the dirty-minded
wretch, having none but coarse formulas
in his vocabulary, tries to address her with
the reverence he feels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>On all this the moralist may comment
that decency as a matter of art is one
thing, and the protection of public morals
is another; that however artists may be
interested in the decorum of their medium,
or in the general truth of their subject-matter,
the public is also interested
in the motives and the possible effects of
their writing. Granted; but if the moral
point is to be made, as against the artistic,
the artist has his own conclusions to
draw. The first is that one may as reasonably
question the motives of the vice-suppressors
as the motives of the artists.
Better not to question the motives of
either, but if the mean insinuation begins,
it must in justice spread in both directions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
The woman before the velvet curtain,
described by the preacher, seemed a
vision of loveliness; yes, you may say,
but what would be the motives of those
who produce such an exhibition—worship
of beauty, or wish to capitalize our baser
impulses? The question is unanswerable
unless you can see into men’s hearts, but
it applies also to the minister who preached
the sermon; was he interested only in
morals, or was he capitalizing to some extent
our craving for the sensational? An
artist would be content to answer that
where the result is beautiful, in the decorum
of the art, it is sensible as well as
kind to suppose men’s motives of the best;
and when the result is not beautiful, it is
sufficient to condemn the result, without
reference to the motives.</p>

<p>But the more actively censorious hold
that the weak need to be saved from themselves;
that a constant brooding upon indecencies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
is the death of the soul. Well,
if it is obscenity that we war against, by
all means root it out, for it can be recognized
at a glance, and the reformer need
not brood long upon it. But in the realm
of art in which decency rises, the suppression
of indecency involves as much brooding
on it by the reformer as by the endangered
public—in fact, the reformer
must specialize in such brooding. Whether
or not it is to the death of his soul, it seems
to be to the impairment of his taste. You
cannot give all your time to bad art and
know much about good. The rôle of the
censor would take on some dignity if there
ever were a censor who was a connoisseur,
who was the patron of good poets and
painters, who actively supported a clean
stage. But then, if you had the taste
for the best, no inducement whatever
would make you give your life to the
detection of indecency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>Human nature is wiser in the long run
than any censor; in the long run the books
of the highest decency hold their place in
fame by crowding out the others. The
public suppresses indecent books by reading
decent ones. Every artist would respectfully
suggest this method to all censors.
Perhaps the censors will say that
the method is too slow—that it takes too
long for the good books to crowd out the
others. It does take too long now, but
why not hasten the process by calling
attention to the good books, instead of
delaying it by advertising the bad? If
the energy which now tries to suppress
books sure to be forgotten in fifty years,
were directed to the encouragement of the
few books which after fifty years might
still be worth reading, the final verdict of
fame might be hastened. But there seems
to be a decorum in morals too, or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
two decorums, a creative and a negative—one
seeking to displace evil by a positive
good, the other too much preoccupied with
the evil to notice the good at all.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dropcap">If we accept the doctrine of criticism
today, originality is a great virtue in
a writer, and if we believe the book advertisements,
all the new writers as they
appear, and as they reappear, have this
virtue to a striking, even to an explosive
extent. But with all their originality,
some of the new books turn out to be dull,
and if we reconsider for a moment the
books men have finally judged great, we
observe that they were rather destitute of
the kind of originality we talk of nowadays.</p>

<p>“In poetry, a new cadence means a new
idea”, wrote the imagist some time ago,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
defending the use of free verse. The doctrine
was in the interest of the cadence,
but it implied something larger and more
significant, that in poetry newness of ideas
is desirable. More recently, an American
critic remarked, in effect, that what Lytton
Strachey has accomplished in his literary
portraits is nothing but what Gamaliel
Bradford accomplished in his, and since
Mr. Bradford’s portraits came first, they
should have the credit and the praise which
an undiscriminating world bestows on Mr.
Strachey’s. If the question of priority is
raised in this kind of writing, perhaps
something should be said for Plutarch;
but are we sure we should raise the question
of priority? What arrests us in the
remark of the American critic is the undebated
assumption that literary excellence
derives from doing something before
somebody else does it. Is it the business
of art to discover new ideas, or indeed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
busy itself much with any ideas, as separated
from emotion and the other elements
of complete experience? Is it the originality
of genius in art to say something no
one has ever thought of before, or to say
something we all recognize as important
and true? As for the mere question of
priority, even stupid things have been
said for a first time; do we wear the laurel
for being the first to say them?</p>

<p>One suspects that the new cadence will
persist in poetry only if we like it, and that
Mr. Bradford’s reputation will outstrip
Mr. Strachey’s only if we prefer what he
wrote, and if by chance we care for neither,
then both will be neglected, though one
preceded the other by a hundred years.
Excellence is the only originality that art
considers. They understand these things
better in France. There the young poet
even of the most radical school will respect
the bias of art towards continuity rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
than toward novelty, toward the climax of
a tradition rather than its beginning; his
formula of self-confidence will be, “Victor
Hugo was a great poet, Alfred de Musset
was a great poet, and now at last I’m
here.” But in America the parallel gospel
is, “Poor Tennyson couldn’t write, nor
Longfellow, of course; now for the first
time let’s have some poetry.”</p>

<p>The writers finally judged great, so far
from sharing our present concern for
originality, would probably not even understand
it. What is the object of literature?
they would ask. Of course, if it is
to portray the individual rather than human
nature, or those aspects of life which
stand apart from life in general, then each
book may have something queer in it,
something not in any other book and in
that sense original; but then the reader,
before long, will be looking for peculiarity
in every book he buys—it must be, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
better, but “different”, to use an American
term in esthetics; and the writer then
who would meet this demand for the peculiar
must make a fresh start with every
book. What bad luck, they would say, to
be forever a primitive, to be condemned,
after every success, to produce something
in another vein, the first of its kind. Originality
in this sense will be continually undermined
by fame, for the more an author
is read, and the more people become accustomed
to his world, the less he will seem
original. On the other hand, if the reader
looks for originality, there will be no fame,
for no matter how popular an author is,
we shall read his book only once, and then
be waiting for his next novelty.</p>

<p>But if the object of literature is still, as
it was for the great writers, to portray
human nature, then the only new thing
the artist will look for is a greater success
in his art. Human nature is old and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
unchangeable; he will hope to make a better
portrait than has yet been made—better,
at any rate, for his own people and
his own age, and if possible better absolutely.
There is nothing new about religion
or love or friendship, war, sunsets,
the sea, danger or death, yet something
remains to be told of each eternal theme,
and when a book comes which tells the
whole, which satisfies some hitherto unexpressed
yearnings or defines more sharply
something hitherto half-seen, then that
portrait of human nature serves our purposes
until we have a still finer, and other
versions meanwhile are neglected and forgotten.
We remember how many accounts
of Romeo and Juliet there were before
Shakespeare told the story to suit us,
and how many records of the journey to
hell before Dante told us the whole truth
of that pilgrimage; perhaps we know the
many desperate attempts, long since mercifully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
swallowed up in oblivion, to portray
the American Indian before Fenimore
Cooper made the picture the world
wanted. The achievements of literature
are all, as in these instances, a gradual reworking
of traditional or popular or folk
material, and in the process it is precisely
because the subject is not original that the
audience can decide how well it has been
portrayed. A sequence of writers interpreting
Life are therefore like a succession
of virtuosos playing the classics, each trying
to give us the true Bach, Beethoven,
Chopin, Schumann. Their renderings
will be different enough, but the music is
the same, and we know it by heart. The
player who calls our attention to most
beauty in it, will be original or unique in
the only way that art permits.</p>

<p>The example of the musician may not
seem to all writers a fair parallel; they
may protest that the writer creates, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
composer does, but the player only interprets
what is already created. But they
are wrong, and the parallel is correct.
The writer does not create as the composer
does. Music is an ultimate pleasure
in itself, like the taste of sugar; so long as
it delights us, we do not ask what it means.
Moreover, since there is no question of its
meaning, we may not need a previous experience
to find some enjoyment in it; it
may be satisfactory at first contact. Of
course every art gives a more subtle pleasure
as we become practised in appreciating
it, yet the contrast between music and
literature remains a real one, since without
any knowledge of life at all men and
even children often penetrate deeply into
the heart of music, but without some
knowledge of life they are stopped at the
very threshold of literature. The key to
that door is some first-hand acquaintance
with life. Music has no other subject-matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
than itself, but literature has life for
its content, and to find one’s way about in
it, we must recognize what it is dealing
with. Life is a music already composed.
It has been here a long time, and had become
already an ancient history when the
first poets began to play upon it. They
merely said for us the things we had been
vainly feeling after, they brought out the
colors our eyes had almost missed, they
defined sharply the flavors and the half
tastes that had haunted us. The amateurs
in the audience listen spellbound when the
master plays to perfection a piece they
have struggled with; this is more to them
than the loveliest of new sonatas, for it is
their own world in a better light. So
mankind will listen to the authentic poet
who completes their half-realized selves;
and will say of him, somewhat with the
woman of Samaria, “He told me all the
things that ever I did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>If the audience enjoy the music best
when they have tried to play it themselves,
they love it next best when they have
heard it often, and they like it least, sometimes
not at all, when they hear it for the
first time. The reader likes poetry best
when he has lived what it interprets; next
best when he has heard often of the adventures
it renders; least, even to the point
of detestation, when he never entered that
region of life at all, not even by hearsay.
In such a predicament the real ground of
his objection to the art is that it is original,
at least so far as he is concerned, but the
experience of his discomfort will hide the
cause of it from him; not himself but the
art will seem to him inadequate—is he not
as much alive as any one ever was? The
book, he will say, portrays a world that is
dead. Let us start fresh and be original;
let us portray my world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>In the slow fermentation of human societies,
as fresh elements work their way
to the top and for a time give their flavor
to history, the new arrival is likely to
herald himself in some such terms in a
protest against the art which, because he
has as yet no share in it, seems to him old
and worn out, and in a cry for original
expression which to those with a longer
memory of the world will be quite familiar.
There have been new arrivals before, and
their wish to start fresh is the cause rather
than the result of decadence. For it is
only in a figure of speech that art declines
or prospers—it is the artists who are less
competent or more so than their predecessors,
and the poet who tells us that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
period before him is at an end, is really
proclaiming that he cannot improve upon
it, and if the other poets are like himself,
the preceding period is indeed ended.
There is no other reason why the great
moments of literature were not prolonged.
Shakespeare was better than his predecessors,
but he was not perfection; why
did not the drama continue to develop?
Ben Jonson, being himself a new arrival,
and being, for all his book learning, outside
the spiritual regions which Elizabethan
drama had mainly portrayed,
thought of course that a new kind of art
was needed. He is in danger now of sharing
the ignominy of all writers who coming
after greater men pay homage through
jealousy. Tennyson was not the greatest
of poets; why did not his successors treat
him as though he were a Greene or a Marlowe,
and make Shakespearean improvements
in him? To hear the critics of today<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
rail against his art, one might suppose he
had hopelessly damaged the language by
using it, or that rhyme and meter had
come to a bad end at his hands. The poet
who talks this way about his predecessors
is never the one who is conscious of the
power to swallow them up. If Shakespeare
had been a little man, he would
have taken one look at Marlowe’s <cite>Faustus</cite>,
and given up the Elizabethan drama as a
creaking and antiquated machine for
moral doctrine. Had he been really ignorant
of the long-stored-up energies and
impulses which were coming to action in
his marvellous hour, had he lacked the instinct
to recognize them even when badly
expressed, and to express them better, he
might have walked the streets of London
as the oriental arrival walked in Athens,
or as the invader from the north walked
in Rome—with a conviction that the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
of this sort of thing was over. Nothing
would remain but to be original.</p>

<p>If the clamor for originality is strong
in the United States, it is, perhaps, because
here are many arrivals, and the
newcomer not infrequently desires us to
change our ways in the interest of his comfort.
We have so much good will toward
him, and we are so conscious of the fine
things the various races may bring to our
commonwealth, that we usually hesitate
to speak frankly of his qualifications as
writer or critic. He often brings a rare
aptitude for art, and frequently he desires
to write, but writing is the one art where
his ignorance of life will handicap him. In
painting an eye for color, in music an ear
for tone and harmony, may carry him
through, but in literature he will write in
an acquired language, and even if it were
his native tongue, in literature his attitude
toward the art will be conditioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
by his knowledge of life. He will perhaps
assert rather vigorously that his
knowledge is superior; has he not borne
hardships and risen above them? Those
who have not suffered, he will say, know
nothing of life. He will think you cold-blooded
if you tell him the better way to
say it—that those who have not suffered,
know nothing of suffering. If he desires
to write the literature of suffering, he is
probably competent, but since he is usually
a person of strong energy, with a constructive
temperament, he does not wish to
write merely the literature of suffering,
nor does he usually wish his children to
repeat his hardship, though he may have
said that only by such discipline comes
knowledge. He usually desires to write
about the world in general, as every one
would write, and for this task he usually
has had experience too meagre or too special.
It is only in the United States, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
his arrival, that he most often makes his
first contact with the older literature—not
of America but of his own land; if he has
had the experience necessary for understanding
it, he absorbs it eagerly, but if
his hardships in his fatherland deprived
him of the necessary equipment, he will
announce that the old literature is played
out and meaningless. He is like the native
students in South African schools, who
may read the skating episode in Wordsworth’s
<cite>Prelude</cite>, but cannot get the shiver
of the ice or the scratch of the steel runners.
Those who have been with us for
several generations and who through economic
or other causes have missed that rich
acquaintance with life which would explain
what the great writers talk about,
are likely to join the most recent comer in
a plea for originality. Their fortunes are
to be pitied, but their advice in art is
hardly to be followed. No amount of sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
or admiration for them as human
beings will accredit them as critics, for
art is long, as we have heard, and the approaches
to it are long also; though we
may teach democracy fast enough to win
our vote after five years, we must know
at first-hand youth and maturity, and
have a suspicion of what old age is like,
in the world the poet writes of, before we
can give a fair opinion whether he has
written well. But if the newcomer recovers
here the adventure of life which his
hardships cheated him of in the old country,
he will find that the great literature
of the world represents that adventure
faithfully and vitally; it is merely a question
of patience with him, since he is energetic
and the upturn of the new world is
exciting, and it is hard for him to believe
that the old shadows in art of a life he has
not yet lived will ever again take living
form or pulse again in his imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>A new world, a new life, a new art.
This is the sequence his hopes dwell on,
though every term in it is debatable. Is
there a new world, or a new life, or a new
art? Sometimes we are told that in a new
world life must automatically be new, but
the doctrine is not convincing, for at other
times we are summoned to originality, as
to another duty, by the argument that in
a new world we ought to be ashamed to
lead still an old life. Sometimes we hear
that a new life inevitably means a new art,
and we reflect that if life now differs from
what it once was, we need take no thought
for our originality, for we shall be different
in spite of ourselves; even by the old
methods art will achieve something new;
if we would write of love, for example,
we need only tell the truth about the passion
as we know it, and since the love we
know is like nothing that ever was on sea
or land, our romance will be like nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
that ever was in song or story. Why all
this fret about it? And if religion and war
and sorrow and death are all by hypothesis
quite other than they once were, how can
we escape originality when we report them
in the setting of the new world and the new
life? But the fact is that those who call
for originality in art are not quite sure,
after all, that the age is a new one—they
would feel safer if some further vestiges of
the past could be obliterated; and though
they justify a new art by speaking much of
their new life, it is far from clear that they
really think life is new, or at heart desire
it to be so. Social and political systems,
yes—but life? Horrible indeed is the vision
of an absolutely original career for
one who loves his fellows and prefers to
take his experience outside a madhouse.
“Your prayer is answered,” says the original
Apollo, touching the original poet’s
ears, trembling with originality: “you will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
have always a new cadence and a new
idea; neither the language nor the substance
of your communications will ever
have occurred before in human experience.
Your art will be unique and solitary.
Nothing that men have done before will
you condescend to repeat—neither to
sleep, nor to eat, nor to travel, nor to
know passion, pain, suffering or peace.”
The poet, lured by the prophecy, might
think at last that he had achieved fame,
but Apollo would be there to remind him
that his was like no fame achieved before—not
like Shelley’s or Shakespeare’s. He
might lose his heart, and in the throes of
love might fancy he knew at last the meaning
of Romeo’s story or Tristram’s, but
the god would remind him that his was a
special kind of love, not like the very ancient
impulse that moved the sun and the
other stars.</p>

<p>We need some divine reminder that our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
true desire is to realize in ourselves the
best of old experience—not to find an
original life, but to bring on the stage once
more as far as possible the old procession
of passions, sorrows and delights. The
latest of us hopes he is not too late to taste
for himself the high flavor of life which
those before him talked so much about. If
falling in love is a business incidental to
adolescence, yet it is immensely hastened
by our reading and by what we have
heard; those whom the passion does not
touch usually worry about their immunity
instead of being thankful for it, and
anything is better than never to have loved
at all. It is not passion entirely that fills
the hearts of the lovers brought at last to
each other’s arms; at least, the single
thought with which the two hearts beat
may be a triumphant “Now I know for
myself.” Similarly, however strange it
may seem, we welcome sorrow and suffering,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
or we feel ourselves cheated rather
than blest if none of it comes our way.
Death, too, is less unwelcome than it might
fairly be. At least those who faced it and
have been reprieved, often remember that
a satisfaction in knowing the worst took
some of the terror away. There it was at
last, the old shadow that waylays us all.</p>

<p>Desiring to discover for ourselves the
well known and traditional experience, we
desire at the same time a more excellent
version of it than our predecessors have
enjoyed. We would love as Romeo did,
but we like to think that Romeo never
loved so well, and ours is a more wonderful
Juliet. Even our sorrows will be greater,
if we have our way, for in the intensity
with which we explore the old experiences
we feel rightly that we ought to equal or
surpass other men. We dread the operation
for appendicitis, before we undergo
it; then we reach the point of satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
in finding out for ourselves what the operation
is like; then finally we are persuaded
that the operation was unusually
severe, the worst of its kind. This is the
artist in us, trying for distinction. And
if with the old material of life we seek the
distinction of excellence of statement, our
motive is not simply a desire to surpass
others, nor a desire to indicate progress,
but often it is the hope to report the experience
once for all. Art has always a
dying part in it, as artists well know—some
part which must constantly be restored
by restatement. Try as he may to
express only permanent things, the artist
will include something that is aside from
the main purpose, that goes out of date.
Of course if an artist deliberately strives
to be contemporary, and succeeds, his work
to that extent will shortly become unintelligible;
later poets will then try their
hand at refurbishing or restoring the essential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
thing in the picture, and incidentally,
without meaning to, they will include
some contemporary and insignificant
material of their own, which in time may
precipitate another revision. What we
call classics are the lucky masterpieces in
which the permanent elements are so many
and the transitory so few, that it seems
useless and impertinent to revise them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The desire for originality is not new,
and explanations of it are old. Some of
them are based on the supposed working
of the artistic temperament. The artist,
it is said, craves expression at all costs,
and if the craving is not satisfied in one
direction, it will reach in another. If we
cannot pour all of our energy into our
painting or our music, we may express the
surplus in long hair and flowing cravat.
This explanation, even if it were true,
would imply that the artist desires notoriety
rather than expression, for you cannot
express yourself unless you speak a language
your audience already knows, but
eccentricity, which is the extreme form of
originality, will attract attention even if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
it is not understood. But artists are not
likely to admit that this theory does justice
to their temperament. They will remark
that few of the greatest masters have
been eccentric in their appearance, none of
them in their subject-matter. Like other
men they fitted the society in which their
lot fell, except that they had a genius for
feeling life more vitally than other men.
So many of them, like Chaucer or Shakespeare
or Scott, cultivated the art of living
close to their fellows and sharing an average
fate, that we half suspect the less
gifted would do the same if they could;
for the artist who is original in dress or
manners is not likely to meet human nature
in its normal state—rather, his neighbors
will whisper when he appears, and
nudge each other, and he will never see
what manners they use toward those who
are not queer. Poets with an original or
eccentric subject-matter meet the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
fate. Could Poe or Baudelaire learn anything
about us if they came among us with
a reputation for the abnormal? Would we
not unconsciously close to them our usual
impulses, in our curiosity to observe their
strangeness? To the artist who loves life
in the sane way of a Chaucer, a Montaigne,
a Molière, such a welcome would
be calamitous; rather hide anything that
distinguishes him from others, even the
fact that he can write, if by this caution
he may draw closer to his sensitive race,
and observe the undisturbed mystery and
beauty of natural life.</p>

<p>Indeed, the whole question of originality,
this desire for novelty, is in the end
a question of our love of life. In the moments
when we love life passionately we
are not likely to get too much of it, and we
do not ask to exchange it for another kind.
When art and politics were creative, in
the heyday of writers, painters, architects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
and statesmen who later seem to us almost
solitary in their excellence, there was still
no taking thought to be original; they fell
in love, rather, with the obvious. Columbus
made no voyage in search of originality—simply
there had been too many hints
and rumors for him to stay at home any
longer. Some very original spirits, we
may suppose, took no stock in his expedition.
For Shakespeare or Molière play-writing
was an obvious task, and an old
one; they may have expected to do successfully
what others had only tried, but except
for the success they aimed at nothing
new. Where great poets have spoken on
the matter themselves, their point of view
is quite clear. At the end of the <cite>Vita
Nuova</cite> Dante announced his hope to write
of Beatrice such things as had never been
written of any woman. Not to write a
new kind of book, for women had been
praised before, as he implied, and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
had been poems of vision and pilgrimages
through hell; but his hope was to excel.
He determined to speak no more of his
blessed lady until he could praise her
worthily, and to praise such a woman
worthily would be to write such things as
had been written of no other. In the same
mood Milton promised his great epic—in
passionate love of the best before him, and
in the assurance of doing as well or better—“I
began thus to assent both to them
and divers of my friends here at home,
and not less to an inward prompting,
which now grew daily upon me, that by
labour and intense study, which I take to
be my portion in this life, joined with the
strong propensity of nature, I might leave
something so written to after-times as they
should not willingly let it die.” This is
the great manner of the poets. But in
the opening words of Rousseau’s <cite>Confessions</cite>,
to take an opposite example, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
have the accent of the modern disease; he
would undertake, he said, an enterprise of
which there had never been a parallel, and
of which there would be no imitation—he
would tell the truth about one man, about
himself. He promised no excellence except
the uniqueness of the subject, for
truth-telling, though always desirable, can
hardly be important unless the subject is
worth while.</p>

<p>Rousseau’s book is great in spite of its
introductory sentence; his subject after
all was not unique, for each of us can follow
his example and write at least one
book about ourselves; and perhaps he told
less of the unvarnished truth than he intended,
for being an artist in every fiber
of his body, he selected from his experience
not his most singular adventures, but
his adventures in those realms of experience—in
sex, for example—which his
readers were surest to understand and find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
interesting. But with his famous announcement,
whether or not he followed it,
our malady began. Hence all the poems
and novels of autobiography, all the diaries
of young men and maidens, old men
and children, all the bouquets of verse still
showered upon us in which the poet confides
his intimate symptoms. In all this
there is little to remind us of great art, or
of the times in which great art has been
made; the resemblance is rather to a hospital
or an old folks’ home, where the inmates
find importance in the fact that they
have been there longer than their fellows,
or are younger, or a little less blind and
deaf. Hence also our difficulty in understanding
earlier literature, of a date when
not originality but excellence was the aim.
When we first read Shakespeare’s sonnets
or Sidney’s, we conclude with satisfaction
that the poet was writing out of his heart,
in the Rousseau fashion. But when we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
learn that these stories are works of art,
dramatic renderings of life, and that the
“I” who speaks in the lines is first of all
the hero of the story, whether or not he is
the poet too; and when we learn further
that much of the material is adapted from
earlier poets, used over again as we use
old words to make up new sentences—then
perhaps our respect for the master vanishes,
our ideal is cracked; they were not
such original poets after all. It is the
defect of our taste. We forget that the
oldest phrases, if they have the poetic
excellence of being true to all of us, are
renewed and become personal in the adventure
of each individual. Though Job
ought to get the credit, by all modern
standards, of uttering that very original
profession of faith, “I know that my redeemer
liveth”, yet the words were too full
of possible meanings to remain linked with
Job’s private misfortunes; being already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
immortal, they seem never to have been
said for a first time. Lover after lover has
found in his own passion the meaning of
some old song, perhaps “My love is like
the red, red rose”, which until the passion
fell on him seemed sentimental and
silly. And Rousseau himself in the <cite>Confessions</cite>,
at the very outset of his egotism,
of his originality, of his indecorous opposing
of the individual to the race, records
his boyhood love of an old folk-song—precisely
the kind of art from which his
doctrine led us away.</p>

<p>But nowadays the desire for originality
comes not only from the writer; a certain
class of readers also demand it, the kind
of person who reads with an eye out for
imitations and plagiarisms. That plot has
been used before, he says, when two men
are in love with the same woman—or, that
character is copied from so-and-so, when
Pierrot’s father forgives the returning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
prodigal. There are reviewers of this type
also, who read their victims into categories,
calling this poet Tennysonian, that novelist
Meredithian, that essayist Emersonian.
Such categories become less definite as
we read back into the past, for over the
range of a few centuries no plot is new,
nor does any writer seem altogether unlike
the others. There is such a thing as plagiarism,
yet unless one is a fanatic for originality,
the question of plagiarism is of no
great importance; the world is not interested,
and if the author is concerned from
whom the play or the plot is stolen, his
concern is more for his property than for
his art. If his work is stolen unchanged,
it is still as good art as it was before; if
the thief has mangled it, his plagiarized
version will not be so good as the authentic
text; but if by luck he has improved on
what he took, it becomes his, bag and baggage,
so far as fame is concerned. Who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
were the authors of those songs Burns
made over into his masterpieces? Who
were those dramatists and chroniclers
whom Shakespeare rewrote? The names
in many cases can be looked up, but they
are of no account. The world feels that
the great writer conferred a benefit by improving
on the earlier work. What is far
more important, the world also feels that
the great writer, in improving on another
man’s work, actually invaded no private
rights, for the material of literature is life,
and life is no one’s private property.
After the invention of printing, writers
saw the possibility of financial dividends
from their works, and plagiarism is an
aspect of this financial question, but it has
otherwise nothing to do with art. The
world in general continues to think of art
in the old way, as creation rather than as
business, and it quite properly cares little
who does the creating, or who afterward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
receives a money reward. What were
Homer’s annual earnings? Or was it
really Homer? Or who besides David
wrote his psalms? We know instinctively
that these questions are trivial.</p>

<p>But imitation in art is often more apparent
than real. If a poet is in touch
with his age, he will write of the subjects
that interest him, and other poets in
touch with the age will also write about
what interests them, and consequently
they may all write of much the same
thing; they are not imitating each other,
but they are enjoying a common pleasure,
to which one of them may have
shown the way. We often say that the
popular writer is trying to catch the favor
of the public by giving it what it likes, and
in some instances he may be calculating
and his motives unworthy. But it is more
probable that being typical of his age, he
simply likes the same things as his fellows.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
The Elizabethan Londoner liked
historical plays; did Shakespeare write
them only to please his audience, or rather
did he not share the general taste? The
principle here implied will explain why
any poets who have an enormous popularity
will have also an enormous so-called influence.
They are popular because they
share the people’s taste, and the people
therefore find in their work what they like;
but if their subject-matter is so popular,
many others will be writing of it too. The
resulting resemblance is not really an influence,
or rarely is; it is a contemporary
tendency. The poet who is best in the lot
will be remembered. All ran, but one
receives the prize. However, those who
came in second and third are neither imitators
nor plagiarists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>To submit oneself to the impersonal discipline
of art is hard for the young. Few
young writers are lured into the profession
by the impossibility of being original
in their craft, or by the excellent chance
their best works have of becoming anonymous
with time. We can imagine them
pleading for the rights of their personalities;
what on earth did the old pagan
mean by his proud <i lang="la">non omnis moriar</i>, if his
personality was not to survive in his work?
For their comfort let us add that personality
in art is indestructible. If we have
any of it, it will live. And if we mean
personality when we say originality, thinking
of the author rather than of his subject,
then we may add also that genuine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
personality is original in spite of itself.
How hard it is to tell a story twice the
same way; how difficult to form anything
permanent, even habits; how impossible to
get once for all into a rut. A dull lecture,
though we hear it a second time word for
word, is subtly changed, for we no longer
hear it the first time, and “afflictions induce
callosities”, as Sir Thomas Browne
said, and “sorrows destroy us or themselves.”
The record we buy for our phonograph,
though we liked it at first, may
empty itself with each repetition, till the
charm is gone; even the photograph of our
dear ones, framed on the wall, has a tendency
at last to merge itself in the wall
paper. Whatever is repeated in our consciousness
becomes mechanical and unnoticed,
or the edge of it is blunted. To
restore the sharp edges of impression, to
bring back the first flavor of things, is the
ideal of life and of art; only strong personality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
can do it, but where such a personality
comes, it is irresistible and undisguisable.
It shows up best in those
attitudes of life which in other hands
have grown drab and sordid; the contrast
brings out the genius. This kind
of success in life is the art of the actor
who plays a long run, and who gives even
in the one hundredth performance the impression
of a fresh experience. A poorer
actor would have needed a new play long
before. Or we might say that art is a
summary of life—and where will personality
show itself sooner than in summarizing?
When Lafcadio Hearn lectured to
his Japanese students, he followed the
reading of each English poem by a brief
paraphrase in prose, which usually is the
most precious part of his criticism; for
in the retelling, his personality emphasized
what he liked in the verses. If we
could ask Tennyson, Morris, Browning,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
Arnold and Meredith each to write out a
summary of something we all know, we
should have five criticisms, and five revelations
of personality. And there are more
personalities in the world than we may
realize; only they waste themselves in the
search for the original, when all that is
needed is to be sincere.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CULT OF THE NATURAL</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dropcap">It belongs with the confusion of esthetics
in our time that the same people
who ask art to be original often ask it to
be natural. Being natural would appear
at first sight the least original of programmes.
Even if by originality we mean
personality, yet there still seems some
contradiction in the wish at one and the
same time to develop a strong personality
and to remain in a state of nature. Since
it is the thoroughbred, not the wild animal,
that is distinguished from his fellows,
and the cultivated bloom, not the field
flower, that charms by its single self rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
than in quantity, a condition of impulse
close to the unsifted accidents of life
would seem to promise an art notable
chiefly for its volume, its indistinction and
its insignificance. But those who ask art
to be natural never mean completely natural.
In their wiser moments they are
only asking art not to be artificial, or at
least to help them forget it is artificial.
They demand a “realistic and romantic
naturalism”, or “a world of honest, and
often harsh reality”, and what they are
looking for is indicated by the fact that
they find something convincingly lifelike
in a drama of low life or an American
vulgarization of a French farce, but something
strained and mechanical in a comedy
by Sheridan or Oscar Wilde. Art, no
doubt, is still desirable in literature—art
shot through with crude material, to reassure
us that we are human. Since all plays
are highly artificial, naturalness is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the word for the virtue of good plays; they
are convincing, rather, they take us
frankly into another world, and for the
moment make us forget it is not our world
of everyday. Yet those who ask the stage
to be natural are apparently reassured
when through the imaginary world of art
breaks some accent of ordinary speech,
some aspect of our common sordidness.
Here, it seems, we touch earth and are
strengthened.</p>

<p>The cult of the natural at its best asks of
the medium of art also, as well as of the
subject, that it wear a common aspect, untouched
by artifice. Many of the new
poets take as their ideal “the sequence of
the spoken phrase”, with a special dislike
of all “inversions”; the “language of common
speech” will serve their purposes.
Yet most of them are better poets than
their theories would indicate, and their
practise, like Wordsworth’s in a similar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
predicament, is perhaps sufficient guide to
the kind of naturalness they are after. <cite>An
Extempore Effusion upon the Death of
James Hogg</cite> is the kind of naturalness
Wordsworth fell into when he was off his
guard. “Other poets”, says a more modern
cultivator of naturalism, “will come
and perchance perfect where these men
have given the tools. Other writers, forgetting
the stormy times in which this
movement had its birth, will inherit in
plenitude and calm that for which they
have fought.” Most of us who are convinced
that all speech is artful in so far as
it is intelligible, can occasionally put up
with a bit of fine writing like this, but we
note in passing that “perchance” and
“plenitude” are not the language of common
speech today. As for the fear of inversions
and the sacredness of the natural
word-order, it is enough for the moment
to observe that no one order is natural for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
all peoples, nor for any one speech at all
times; different word-orders express different
states of emotion, even different
ideas, and one is as natural as the other.
“Tell me not in mournful numbers” or
“Tell not me in mournful numbers”—which
is the natural order? From another
and contemporary New England poet,
who sticks valiantly for the natural sequence
of speech, we may examine a
characteristic line, which has as high a percentage
of nature in it as absence of art
can insure—“I must pass that door to go
to bed.” Would it be less natural to say,
“To go to bed, I must pass that door”?</p>

<p>To practise artifice and yet to seem
spontaneous, to be natural and yet to
achieve art—these ancient paradoxes
against which the cultivators of the natural
arrive, in both the subject-matter and
the medium of literature, need to be examined
in greater detail, but it is well to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
observe them first in a general way, in
order to mark how much confusion lies on
the very surface of such thinking. It is
emotion perhaps rather than thinking; it
is a protest in another form against what
seems old and inherited; it is an impatience
with art itself. Yet art exerts its
old charm upon us all, and the worshipper
of the natural succumbs unawares to every
triumph over nature. In American letters
we fix on Abraham Lincoln as our
type of natural expression; the legend of
his humble beginnings and the plainness
of his manner deceive us into a conviction
that he was less indebted to art than
Thomas Jefferson, and we therefore talk
of the rhetorical extravagances of the Declaration
and contrast them with the Attic
simplicities of the Gettysburg Address.
Perhaps we see a final proof of our sound
taste in the story that Matthew Arnold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
gave up the Address for lost when he got
to the colloquial “proposition”; “dedicated
to the proposition”, we say, was more than
his artificial spirit could bear. Whether
Arnold expressed such an opinion, or
whether he would have been right in so
doing, is of less consequence than our
emotional readiness, if we cultivate the
natural, to accept the Lincoln speech as an
illustration of our ideal, and to set it over
against the artifice of Jefferson’s great
document—to detect a literary manner in
such a phrase as “When in the course of
human events”, and nothing but naturalness
in “Fourscore and seven years ago”—or
to find an empty and sounding rhetoric
in “life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness”, but only the democratic syllables
of common sense in “government of
the people, by the people, for the people.”
Both documents are as rich as they can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
well be in rhetoric, as all great oratory is,
and of the two, Lincoln’s as a matter of
fact is rather more artful in the progress
of its ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Our confusion in the search for the natural
in art springs from the many different
meanings that attach to both words, art
and nature. For most of us, perhaps, art
is a decoration, something supplementary
to life; in the spirit of this definition we
understand what it is to cultivate the arts—to
buy pictures when our means will
permit us that addition to more primary
interests, or to attend the opera after the
preliminary stages of our social pilgrimage.
We use the word art so often in this
bad sense, with the implication of insincerity,
that there is something bracing in
any invitation to return to nature and to
be once more what we were while we still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
were honest with ourselves and had a sense
of humor.</p>

<p>This nature that we return to, haunts
our thoughts as a fixed state in which the
wise soul can find enduring refuge. Just
how we get the idea that nature is stable,
is not easy to see; the notion often exists
in our minds side by side with a deep conviction
that life is a flux, and that time
and space are but relative terms in the
universal stream. But perhaps it is the
outer appearance of the world, nature as
landscape, that first suggests a refuge even
against time, mountains are so immovable
in their mysterious silence for us as for
Wordsworth, the ocean is so untamable
for us, as it was for Byron. Perhaps also
the contemplation of the changing universe
during the past century of daring
and imaginative science has endowed nature
with a romantic career of its own, such
as the old humanists ascribed only to men;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
perhaps the progress of stars, planets and
solar systems, observed or guessed at, suggests
in spite of the evolution it illustrates
a deeper kind of rest in the laws by which
that evolution conducts itself; so that the
last result of turning from human art to
watch the behavior of inanimate things is
the conviction that nothing is really inanimate,
but that all move in the wisdom of
an art superhuman, in an order peaceful
and eternal as only a divine vitality could
conceive. When we think of nature in
this sense of the word, leaving man out of
the picture, ourselves too as far as possible
who do the thinking, we are ready to say
with Emerson that art is an impertinent
intrusion, nature is all. “Nature in the
common sense refers to essences unchanged
by man; space, the air, the river,
the leaf; art is applied to the mixture of
his will with the same things, as in a
house, a canal, a statue, a picture; but his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
operations taken together are so insignificant,—a
little shaping, baking, patching
and washing,—that in an impression so
grand as that of the world on the human
mind they do not vary the result.”</p>

<p>We can speak of nature in this all-embracing
way so long as, like Emerson for
the moment, we lay aside every thought of
man and of the moral world which he creates
or brings under his control, and in
which his responsibility is fixed. But once
we resume that human outlook, we begin
to use the word natural in at least two
other senses. In the first place we use it
to describe the process of life, that constant
birth or becoming which seems to
have been present to the mind of the Greek
also when he used his word for nature—as
when Aristotle says, in a famous phrase,
that art is an imitation of nature, meaning
that the process of art is a copy of the
processes of birth and becoming, and creates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
by the same methods that life does.
In this sense of the word nature is like
art, not opposed to it, and with this interpretation
Polixenes tried to rebuke the
cult of the natural in Perdita, who would
not have in her garden a flower artificially
bred:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet nature is made better by no mean,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But nature makes that mean: so, o’er that art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which you say adds to nature, is an art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A gentler scion to the wildest stock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And make conceive a bark of baser kind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By bud of nobler race: this is an art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which does mend nature—change it rather: but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The art itself is nature.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We use the word nature also to describe
the raw material of life which is the result
of a previous birth or becoming. It is
what some earlier art, human or divine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
has already worked on, and what we must
work on now if art is to continue. Nature
in this sense is the marble, the color, the
language which are to be the mediums of
various arts; human passions and instincts
also, the social and the material environments
which attend our lives, the accidents
of fortune which make up their
plots; and since all this is what art must
work upon, nature so defined is forever
somewhat opposed to art, as inanimate
materials are opposed to the workman, as
the wood and the chisel are opposed to the
carpenter. For art is the use of the materials
of life for human benefit, a method
employed for a premeditated end in a
world which except for art might seem
given over to chance. Because it is a
rearrangement and a control of nature to
effect the will of man, life itself, so far as
it becomes civilized, becomes an art. But
in a world as old as ours the raw material<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
with which art deals is itself the result of
art; the wood has been already shaped
into boards, the chisel and the hammer
have been made into tools before the carpenter
touches them, and the environment
in which the carpenter is born, the instincts
and passions he inherits, the turns
and coincidences of his fate, are all probably
the result of what others before him
made of their materials and opportunities.
Thinking of life so, we see it as an alternation
of nature and art, or as an alternation
in which what first is art becomes
afterwards nature, all the achievement of
one generation turning into mere starting
point and opportunity for the next; and
thinking of life so, we understand how
nature, to the true artist, is forever set
over against art in a contrast that implies
affection rather than antagonism, for those
who instead of defining art as a decorative
supplement to life identify it with civilization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
itself, are free to love nature without
abandoning an ideal, as a sculptor is free
to love fine marble, or the painter to love
his medium of tint and tone. With time
and by such a process of reworking, nature
draws nearer and nearer to art; the
raw material is made constantly more orderly
by rearrangement, as a field is enriched
by plowing in the crops. Even in
the sphere of human character this is true,
in the very seat of the natural, in our instincts
and passions; for though we may
agree that character should be measured
by a moral career rather than by impulses
wholly innate, yet it is well to reflect that
your impulses and sentiments, if you are
born and brought up in Florence or Chartres,
Heidelberg or Seville, are likely to
be different from the impulses and sentiments
natural to a child born or brought
up in The Bronx or in Hoboken. In the
eyes of the naturalist, nature is all, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Emerson said, and art only a little shaping,
baking, patching and washing, but to
the artist who carries in his imagination
something of the scope of agelong growth
and creation, the truth is what Nature said
to the poet in Voltaire’s dialogue—“They
call me nature, but by this time I am become
all art.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The possibility, then, of returning to
nature disappears when we realize how
long a road we have traveled; all that the
most primitive minded of us can do is to
stick close to the raw material of his own
life, to the circumstances with which the
art of his predecessors surrounded him.
This is the nature which the realists cultivate
today. They report those facts of
life from which art might take its beginning,
but they report them as much as
possible in an arrested state, for fear they
might pass on into art. Among the poets
one, catching the accent of the spoken language,
gives us the language of one phase
of New England; another, with a like
faithfulness to the natural cadence, gives
us another kind of New England speech;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
a third has the colloquialism of Illinois.
They are all artists, or they would not
mean much to us, but in so far as they
have followed their own ideals of the natural
they have laid aside some of the magician’s
robes to which by inheritance they
are entitled, and they leave with us their
renderings of our world in a form of utterance
less noble than their theme and out
of harmony with it. In our prose and
verse alike, the studied inadequacy of style
to the occasion is a standing reproach to
us, all the worse since it is often the pose
of an inverted vanity, like the democratic
conviction still flourishing in the land that
the dinner coat or the evening coat is an
artifice of a worn-out society, whereas the
senatorial frock coat and wide hat are
natural and God-given sheathings of our
original nakedness.</p>

<p>To revert to the starting point of our
lives is to seek nature in vain, since the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
alternations of art and nature proceed
relentlessly, whether we rest our dead
weight on the process or try to help it
along. It is a vain flattery of our reluctance
to travel, to take our seat always in
the last car. But, however futile, the cult
of the natural in literature has a reasonable
explanation, and it is well to understand
with sympathy why it is likely to
recur periodically in a civilization that
must feel its age more and more. Art
criticizes life, as we have often been told,
by selecting or sifting it; that is what the
word criticism means. The authority that
art has over us, its right to make such a
sifting, derives not from books but from
the human brain itself, from the method of
memory; we remember only by forgetting
most of the things we have done or have
suffered, and rearranging the rest. As we
grow older life becomes clearer, we say,
thanks to this selection and forgetting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
When art sifts life, then, it is only imitating
the process of nature, and when we
observe the process we can understand
why the Greeks said that memory was the
mother of the muses. But this sifting of
life on the part of memory and of art is
progressive, and in all honesty we may
wonder at times whether it has not gone
too far. Some of the clarity of vision, the
firmness of doctrine, which is the reward
of old age, may be not the genuine harvesting
of experience which is almost the
gift of prophecy; it may be rather a partial
memory which seems clear because so
much has been left out. If a poet could
get a first-hand impression of life, his art
would be one sifting of nature; if he reacts
not only to nature but to the interpretations
of other poets, his art is a second sifting,
more highly organized, perhaps, more
intelligible, than is normally recorded
from immediate contact with life. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
makes no difference whether we call these
siftings poetry or criticism, since poetry,
as Arnold reminded us, is a criticism of
life. The poet may submit his sensitiveness
to nature as sifted through three or
four or any number of interventions of
personality, and we may call the result
poetry, or criticism, or criticism of criticism;
very often we cannot tell, and the
poet does not know, whether the life that
stimulates him is direct or transmitted.
But in each remove from the first contact
with nature, in each additional intervention
of personality, we get a clearer order
and a finer intelligibility—truth instead
of facts, formulas instead of experiences,
and fewer exceptions. The literature,
then, which begins in naturalism will at
last emerge in philosophy, if we allow it
time enough, and the biography of an individual
will be condensed and generalized
into a proverb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>There are two good reasons, however,
for suspecting this economical result. One
is that the proverb is probably not true.
To arrive at it, in each successive sifting
we have left out something, and the total
of all the omissions has become almost as
comprehensive as the original experience.
We must go back and gather up the discarded
fragments of our adventure, in order
to qualify properly our too simple
and absolute summary of life. The art of
the historian, we often fear, progresses by
some such over-elimination; archæology
sometimes rescues him by restoring large
sections of a past, the absence of which he
had not noticed, but in periods too recent
for archæology to take him by surprise, he
constantly rewrites his history, to sift it
more to his mind, until we may suspect
that his account is nearer to our philosophy
than to the original facts. In history this
tendency is hardly a matter of concern, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
if we have a criticism of the eighteenth century
which satisfies us, we are content, and
the eighteenth century, being dead and
gone, will not mind; the poet, therefore,
can look on with equanimity while the historians
propose to rewrite our national life
in order to bring it more in harmony with
our present sentiments toward this or that
other country; the poet knows that history
is not a science but one of the most fascinating
of the arts, closely allied to eloquence
in its mission to teach and persuade,
and that having to do strictly with
the past it enjoys rare freedom in sifting
its facts. But the poet himself enjoys no
such freedom. Whatever he writes will
be checked up by the life we now live; his
readers will look into their hearts and
criticize. If therefore he has gained his
clarity by leaving out things essential in
our experience, we reject him as too far
from our reality to be of consequence to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the race. He may be a philosopher; he
is no poet.</p>

<p>His philosophy may even be true, and
yet his right to the laurel may be justly
denied. For the special service of art is
to make us live more intensely in the very
life which art sifts and selects—in fact, the
sifting has for its conscious purpose a
more vivid realization of what we live
through, and a novel or a play is successful,
from the standpoint of imaginative
literature, only in the degree to which we
enter the work, become ourselves the hero,
fall in love with the heroine, hate the villain.
In this sense the dime novel and the
melodrama, though carelessly branded by
the theorist as bad art, are likely to be
very good art indeed, and the over-reasoned
story, though adorned with subtle
reflection and refinements of diction, is in
fact poor art, as the average person in his
heart knows, for in such books the reflection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
upon life is paid for by a failure to
represent what the reflection is about. If
the author would only share with us the
adventures that caused him to reflect, we
could do our own reflecting upon them,
but if he will not share the secret which
inspires him, we do not care much what
philosophizing he does. Literature continues
to be great so long as the sifting it
makes it really a selection only from life,
and what remains is for the imagination
still a first-hand experience; when the
residue grows thin to the imagination and
addresses itself rather to logic, we feel
justified in making whatever return we
can to our starting point in nature, to
reassure ourselves there, if we cannot in
the book, that this human life we love is
still with us.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>If such a taking to cover is observed in
much writing today, the writers who in
one form or another now cultivate nature
rather than art may plead with justice that
the best literature our country produced
before them was perilously deficient in a
sense of reality. If they do so plead, however,
they ought to be consistent. If they
think that so great an artist as Hawthorne
was deficient in reality, that transcendental
philosophy occupies too much room
in his romances and the sense of actual
American life too little, then they ought
not to tell us at the same time that Poe
and Whitman are our great poets, for
those two were even further along toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
the abstract than Hawthorne. And there
will be an increasing obligation on those
who in each generation of the fast-ripening
world make a return to nature, to provide
some demonstration that it is not life
after all they are running away from.
Some men have taken to the hermit’s cell
to find God; others to avoid responsibility.
As civilization becomes greater in quantity,
with more discoveries of science, with
more apparatus of education, we need
more and more the poetic genius that will
dedicate this material to great ends, and
by articulating for us what we can recognize
as our best ideal, teach us to simplify
life by casting off the other less significant
interests. The solution of all this raw
material for art can only be a greater art.
When we turn back from this heroic opportunity
to take refuge in what is for us
nature, we must convince ourselves, if we
can that our retreat does not indicate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
in us inadequate equipment or weak nerve
or small heart.</p>

<p>In our present cult of the natural there
is cause to suspect some such lack of skill
and courage. The plea that our predecessors
were so deficient in reality that we,
to save the day, must exhibit less art than
theirs, will not go in the long run. Our
new poetry is curiously relaxed and enervated
in temper, ground-hugging, grey
and flat; if we have moods which such writing
adequately represents, we have other
moments more cheerful and creative,
which our architecture and our engineering
manage to express, but which cannot
be guessed at in our poetry, not as much
as the oak can be guessed at in the acorn.
Our novels, too, have lost their courage,
and though they often represent photographically
the machine of civilization
which builds up around us, and which now
is the raw material on which our art is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
operate, they do not even attempt to portray
the spirit of the artist which actually
pervades the land, the joy in putting the
machine to human uses, the almost divine
ecstasy in having made so much of nature
subject already to the mind. This mood
of confidence in art is as much a fact in
our national life as the number of gallons
that flow over Niagara each hour, but the
poets and novelists seem to have taken
fright.</p>

<p>In both verse and prose, in style as well
as subject, the cult of the natural has
limited our writers to a few individualistic
attitudes, and has taken from them the
power to speak with authority on all subjects
for us all. We have no American
poet, no American novelist; each is the
poet or novelist of Vermont or Boston or
Maine or Chicago—whatever scene is to
him by birth or habit his natural world.
To find a universal utterance of universal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
experience is the aim and the tendency of
art, but the cult of nature compels us to
return each in what state he came. The
counsel to use the language of ordinary
speech limits us to the speech of some
locality; and such limitation is a fatal handicap
for great poetry. The advice to use
only the natural word-order limits us to
the word-order which each of us finds natural,
whereas it is our duty, on the contrary,
if we make any claim to mastery in
literature, to enlarge our vocabulary even
beyond the words our family and our
neighbors made natural to us, and to cultivate
all the variety of word-order our
speech permits, that we may enrich and refine
our style, and render our meaning
more precise. The temptation to get along
with a small vocabulary and a meagre
change of construction is altogether too
natural; we did not need this premeditated
urging to a still greater poverty. Hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the best remedy for a narrow equipment
in language has been to read constantly
in the great writers; it was they
who extended the powers of speech and
laid upon each tongue the shape and cadence
which to the ill-informed might seem
the gift of nature. But now that the ideal
of the writer is to shrink to the measure
of the conversation he is used to, how shall
our nobler moments find expression? Not
even in reading old authors, for by the
contemporary doctrine of naturalness the
old masters are artificial. “Whither thou
goest, I will go, and where thou lodgest, I
will lodge; thy people shall be my people,
and thy God my God. Where thou diest,
will I die, and there will I be buried.” ...
“At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay
down; at her feet he bowed, he fell; where
he bowed there he fell down dead.” ...
“Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the
golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
broken at the fountain, or the wheel
broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust
return to the earth as it was, and the spirit
shall return unto God who gave it.”</p>

<p>These cadences are not natural, and
they are not modeled on the sounds that
habitually fill our ears. Their distinction,
or if you like, their condemnation, is that
they are works of art. Such language
gets away as far as it can from time and
place, and by much sifting out from unessentials
it tries to preserve a universal
appeal. If you can write this way at all,
you can write as well in New York as in
London, as well now as in 1611.</p>

<p>The purpose of art is to make its subject-matter
also universal, to sift and rearrange
the raw material of life into a history
that will have as much meaning as
possible for as many readers as possible,
for as long as possible. But the cult of the
natural tends to the opposite effect—to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
make the subject-matter of literature temporary
in its interest and limited in its
meaning. The Broadway entertainments
which please us for the moment, since they
conform to our taste in the spontaneous,
the impromptu and the natural, are but
the raw material of drama; good plays
might be made out of them; but in each
case the author stops the story before we
pass from nature to art. It is natural, in
the sense of our definition, that a stoker
in modern times should have two ideas—that
to the idle and effete he may seem
akin to the missing link, and that since he
is at the bottom of society, he must be
supporting it. Quite a philosophy can be
made out of two ideas, and these two,
when put together, as in a recent drama,
promise an explosion. But after all,
nothing explodes. The man simply enunciates
his two ideas in different accents of
violence, until the author thinks it is time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
to stop, and gets him strangled in the zoo.
An artist would have been interested to
see in action a character with such a
philosophy. We have recently seen another
play with an idea, a very simple
one; by any means in her power a girl is
going to capture the man she loves. Since
the only means in her power are eccentric
ones, we watch her eccentricity with astonishment
for three acts; her behavior
is original, like nothing that ever was or
will be, and our interest is held by the
growing desperation of her ingenuity.
Well, she gets him—for much the same
reason that the philosophic stoker was
strangled, because it is time for the audience
to go home. An artist would have
granted her ambition as natural, and her
success as natural too; he would have
shown us, however, what happened after
her success, when her philosophy of opportunism
in etiquette would have met its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
test. Had <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite>
been written by the author of either of the
plays just described, the famous comedy
would never have got further than the raw
material of the story, the legend that
Benedick and Beatrice waged a merry war
between them; we should have had an evening’s
entertainment of jokes and insults,
made gradually more intensive, more violent
and more surprising in order to hold
us till the last curtain. Shakespeare,
choosing the way of art, begins rather at
the point where the wit of Beatrice and
Benedick is exhausted; they have the
reputation for it, but their public efforts
show signs of strain and flagging. From
this start in nature the play proceeds to
represent what happened to Benedick
and Beatrice, the witty enemies, when
serious accidents brought their fates together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Nowhere in literature, perhaps, is art
so obviously essential and naturalism so
obviously fatal as in drama, for drama,
by exhibiting life to us directly, quickens
to its utmost whatever desire we have to
see our fellows move on from their natural
beginnings to some achievement or
significant conclusion. Impulses, ideas,
motives, prejudices, passions, and as we
now say, complexes, are all natural forms
of energy; in real life they weary us if
they have only a lyric expression, and we
wish they would get started into action.
Their attempts toward action may be
thwarted, and such a defeat may be tragically
significant, but at least they should
try, and if instead of trying they waste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
themselves in talk, they become not energies
but nuisances. It is for this reason,
we suppose, that Aristotle long ago cautioned
us that tragedy, or all drama, is an
imitation not of men but of an action, and
that plot is the essential thing. He might
have said that character may exist in a
state of nature, but plot presupposes art
in life, a selection from all other incidents
of one succession of events which so selected
have a meaning. What he did say
was that without action there can be no
drama, but there may be without character.
Plot is a generalization of life, in
which the actors may or may not be portrayed
as individuals. The woman who
lost the piece of silver, the good Samaritan,
the mother of Œdipus, are clear
enough in their universal relation to the
story in which they appear; their personalities
may be restated to suit our taste,
or left undefined. We read in the newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
that a man jumps into the river to
save a drowning child, and having got to
land, discovers that he has rescued his
own son. We live in that drama without
asking what was the character of the father
or what was the psychology of the
son.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how Shakespeare illustrates
Aristotle’s doctrine, by showing
his characters in action and by avoiding
as far as possible an analysis of their motives,
their instincts, their prejudices,
their passions. Life with him finds expression
in art or not at all. It is a mirror
indeed which he applies to nature,
not a microscope; in his glass we see the
form of virtue and the features of vice,
we know who are good and who are bad,
at least as accurately as we form such
judgments in life, but we do not know the
motives of the good or the bad. What
were Falstaff’s motives? Should he be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
acted as a comic or a tragic character?
Why did Portia like Bassanio? Why did
Cordelia take such an absolute stand with
her father? What did Hero think of
Claudio, or Hermione of Leontes, after
the restoration to the jealous husband?
Was Hamlet’s mother an accessory to the
murder of his father, or did her conscience
trouble her only because she had made a
second marriage and in such haste? The
profundity of Shakespeare’s art lies in his
genius for representing the surface of
action; in art as in ethics, life is chiefly
conduct, and it is enough that behind conduct
lies unprobed the same mystery that
lies behind existence itself.</p>

<p>But since naturalism thinks otherwise,
Shakespeare is no longer our example.
Browning is more in our vein. For him
the natural man, the raw material of
each one of us, the hidden instincts and
impulses, must be the whole subject, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
action he finds useful only in the fragmentary
incidents that must be premised before
you can conclude anything even
about instincts. Few verdicts in criticism
are wider of the mark than the too familiar
saying that Browning’s genius is
Shakespearean. He is the opposite of
Shakespeare. He is absorbed in what
we call in a loose way psychology, in the
original man apart from his conduct, or
as far apart from it as you can separate
him. To be so concerned about motives
and instincts is to be a kind of inverted
dramatist, moving back from action instead
of toward it; it is no wonder, therefore,
that Browning’s so-called dramas
fail on the stage, since in that direct relation
to the audience their static naturalness,
their inability to live out a significance
in conduct, is pitilessly revealed.
Everybody examines himself and talks
about himself, as God made him; nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
gets under way; the audience is finally delivered
by the death of the soliloquizer,
not in a zoo, but more politely, it may be,
in a gondola. “Even if you string together
a set of speeches expressive of
character,” said Aristotle, “though well
finished in diction and in thought, yet you
will not produce the essential tragic effect
nearly so well as with a play which, however
deficient in these respects, yet has a
plot and artistically constructed incidents.”
To return to nature absolutely
would be to return to silence. Short of
silence, to return to nature in literature is
to confess your private character in
monologue. Browning is master in that
kind. It would be untactful to name the
writers today who share the mastery with
him, and perhaps it is enough merely to
suggest the idea. To save time we might
prudently meditate rather upon the few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
poets and novelists remaining whose art
gets further than monologue.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the universe marches on its
secret errand, not altogether secret since
it marches, and its art is slowly dramatized
in its vast conduct. Art for art’s
sake is a formula inspiring if taken in a
noble sense, but in any sense it is intelligible
as a programme deliberately chosen.
To cultivate nature for nature’s sake is
absurd. For nature is here without our
aid, and to preserve it in what we call its
pure state, we need cultivate nothing—unless
it be a more animal contentedness
to profit in indolence by the art of those
who came before us.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CULT OF THE CONTEMPORARY</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dropcap">“The end of playing”, said Hamlet,
“both at the first and now, was and
is, to show the very age and body of the
time, his form and presence.” It would
seem that Hamlet thought the business of
art was to portray the age in which the artist
lived, not only to address his contemporaries,
but to speak to them about themselves.
The cult of the contemporary,
then, in our own day could ask for no
better text than this phrase of the Prince
of Denmark; what a pity he uttered it so
long ago!</p>

<p>Shakespeare did not agree with Hamlet—at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
least, he made some pretence to show
his Elizabethan audience the form and
presence of remote times and far-away
countries, Rome and Athens, Denmark
itself, Italy, Scotland, Bohemia, the age
of King John and the Richards and the
Henrys, the time and place, whatever they
were, of <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>, the
<cite>Tempest</cite>, <cite>Cymbeline</cite>, the <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite>.
And Hamlet himself, be it noted, is hardly
faithful to his theory, for when he asks
the players to repeat a favorite speech
of his, it turns out to be Æneas’s tale to
Dido. It was from a piece, he said, that
pleased not the million, perhaps never had
a second performance, but in the judgment
of the competent and in his own
opinion it was an excellent play. Perhaps
the million were at the moment bred exclusively
to appreciate contemporary
themes; costume plays were not the fashion.
Hamlet’s other choice in drama is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
poor evidence of his esthetic theory; the
murder of Gonzaga seems to have been
already ancient history, but he chose it
to catch the conscience of the king, since
the story fitted his own household tragedy.
Shall we follow the hint, and suggest that
Hamlet, like Shakespeare, really had
nothing in common with those who would
make contemporary life the proper subject
for art? Perhaps he would not have
mentioned the age and body of the time, if
he had not just said that the end of playing
is to show scorn her own image, if indeed
the purpose of his meddling with the
drama at all, at that moment, had not been
to sting the royal murderer into a confession
of his guilt.</p>

<p>The cult of the contemporary follows
logically from the cult of the natural. If
we are to write of a life untouched with
art, we can write only of life about us, as
our fathers left it to us—our best of nature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
the talent buried in a napkin; and
if we are to use the ordinary language of
men, we must use today’s language, the
only speech that to us is ordinary. And
if it is possible to understand the search
for the natural as an effort to correct the
generalizing tendency in literature, we
may also find a sympathetic explanation
of the insistence on the contemporary,
when we recall how many writers have
reasoned themselves into a determination
to walk in the ways of their heart and in
the sight of their eyes. Did not Homer
celebrate the glory of Hellenism? Did not
Virgil celebrate the empire of Rome?
Well, then, we ought to celebrate the
United States, our United States, rather
than the country of Washington or Jefferson;
we ought to celebrate the hour and
the place we know, for we ought to love
what we know—New York, Boston, Chicago
or the Middle West. This conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
seems rational, but the desired enthusiasm
does not follow; the celebration
of the contemporary in our literature is as
dreary in its results as the worship of the
natural, inspired merely by the sense of
some duty rather than by delight in what is
portrayed. Homer’s zest for Hellenism
is undeniable, and the instinct is right that
we, too, must love life as he loved it before
we can write as he wrote. For the moment
we postpone the question, whether we
must not also live a life as noble in kind as
he portrayed. Virgil, writing in a more
complicated, a sadder age, none the less
loved imperial Rome, and we are right to
think that before we shall be worthy to
sing of our own land, in its own grave and
complex era, we must take it to heart,
problems and all. “The proof of a poet”,
said Whitman, “shall be sternly deferred
till his country absorbs him as affectionately
as he absorbed it.” But Whitman’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
own practise is a provoking comment on
his saying; he succeeded remarkably in
loving his land under an eternal form; the
form and presence of his day he did not
leave us. His poems are no guide-books
to Manhattan and Long Island in 1855;
even his beloved ferry-boats are dateless.</p>

<p>In what sense, then, would Whitman
have us love our country, the home of our
own times, and how did Homer and Virgil,
as artists, love the Greece or the Rome
they knew? To be of one’s age, yet to be
immortal, is a problem more subtle perhaps
than to achieve an art that seems
natural, but it can be solved in the same
way, by defining the terms of our esthetic,
and by referring them, as to a touchstone,
to what we know of our common
human nature. The question can also be
narrowed at the start, and very profitably,
by pressing home our reflections on Hamlet’s
remark to the players. There is one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
kind of writing which does confine itself
to the feature of virtue and the image of
scorn, and which does indeed, for that
very reason, limit itself always to giving
the form and presence of the time—the
kind of writing, that is, which indicts
human nature instead of portraying it.
Our better selves, our ideals, are of no
time, but our faults are personal responsibilities
and strictly contemporary. Satire,
therefore, which holds up to merriment or
to scorn what is ridiculous or base, must
always take a present subject, and in
general any art that leans toward the consideration
of our shortcomings will lean
also toward the life enacted at the moment.
If Hamlet meant to trap the king, of
course he would write into the old play
the very murder the king had committed
only three or four months ago; this would
not be satire in the usual sense, but it
would serve the same end, to convict the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
guilty and to reform the world. The cult
of the contemporary, then, is proper quite
literally for satire; it remains only to ask
how far it is proper for art.</p>

<p>But is satire not art? Did not Martial
and Juvenal, Dryden and Pope write
highly artistic satires? There is an art
of satire, we must answer, as there is an
art of preaching and an art of prosecuting
a criminal case. But if there is a distinction
between art and morals, then satire
belongs to the world of ethics, and of
ethics on the grim side, rather than to the
world of beauty and delight. To survey
and judge the morals of one’s age is a
serious office that no thoughtful and sensitive
person seems altogether to neglect;
if the purpose of art is to make such a survey,
as Hamlet seems to say, then <cite>Twelfth
Night</cite> is hardly a masterpiece in art, and
<cite>Sandford and Merton</cite> is certainly one. If
art, on the other hand, has for its purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
to salvage out of our crude days the
truth which can be translated into beauty,
and which so translated may be a joy
for ever, then art will have as little as possible
to do with men’s faults—what faults
are joys for ever?—and the kind of writing
which confines itself to our frailties or
our sins will be as far removed as possible
from art. Moreover, the moralist desires
a cure of souls, and when the fault is
remedied, who will care for the satire or
even understand it? It is easy enough,
without taking thought, to perish with our
own time, but it is one of the oldest hopes
art has held out to natural man, that being
purified into art he should not altogether
die. But mortality is germane to satire.
When we read Dryden’s terrible excoriations
of Og and Doeg, we can only wonder
who were the human beings he hated so,
and when we come to know something of
their lives and characters, we are more confused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
to name the moral impulse in him
which made it necessary to fix them in so
warm a hell. In art, loving your own
times does not mean loving to find fault
with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>A genuine love of your own time is the
recognition, in what you meet in it, of
those best moments which crave to be made
accessible even for the remotest of ages
following. To immortalize any given moment,
however, is to take it out of the temporary
and somehow to find a language
for it so general in its appeal that hereafter
it may preserve in its own significance
the trivial circumstances from which
it first arose. Whenever a genuine love
of life stirs the artist, it will be a passion
for what he thinks is the best in his own
day; even if he is antiquarian and takes
for object of his devotion some medieval
phase of life, it is medievalism in his own
day that he worships. Such a passion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
leads the writer toward the future, for
since it is an ideal passion, yet to be realized,
he instinctively proclaims it to posterity,
or tries to; but in his search for the
right language in which to utter it, he as
instinctively turns to the past. To cultivate
the contemporary in art is therefore
as absurd as to waste effort cultivating
the natural, for the present, like nature,
is always with us; but the problem
for the artist is to express a vision which
necessarily points toward the future in
language which necessarily trails from the
past. We cannot remind ourselves too
often that even the single words of common
speech must be used by each one of
us perhaps a lifetime before they are
charged with emotions or sharpened to
precise meanings, and before the writer
can use them with full effect they must be
so charged and sharpened for all his readers.
The language of poetry, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
is far more than single words; it is chiefly
the metaphors and the legends, the characters
and the episodes, which the race has
met with so often that at last they suggest
accurately to all men the same feelings
and the same thoughts. Life at each
moment may be on its way to become
something to talk with, but only the rash
would try to express a serious ideal
through a picture of that life which is still
near us, and therefore still imperfectly
seasoned or digested. The patriotism that
Shakespeare dramatized for his audience
was certainly a passion for the England of
Elizabeth; that is why he expressed it
through Faulconbridge, the child of Richard
the Lion-Hearted, or through John
of Gaunt, or through Henry V. Why did
he not put Elizabeth on his stage, with
Raleigh and Spenser and Drake and Sidney?
Was he blind to the glory of his own
hour? He seems not to have been so, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
in his own hour neither the Queen nor any
of her great courtiers was as clear a figure
to the emotions as time has since made
them all; the sentiment of the audience
would be divided as to each one of them,
the adherents to Rome still perhaps cursing
Henry’s daughter in their hearts, the
friends of Ireland perhaps cursing the
poet of the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>. But the wise
dramatist was on safe ground, he knew,
when the audience heard their common
love of country issue unprejudiced from
the lips of old Gaunt, who died two centuries
earlier:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>
<p>When a poet turns to the past for language
with which to express his love of
the present or his vision of the future, he
soon learns that not all epochs lend themselves
with equal felicity to his purpose;
he must select that aspect of the past which
is adequate in nobility and energy to what
he has to say, and he must select that
aspect of the past which will be understood
emotionally by his readers. We are prepared,
every one of us perhaps, to admit
the necessity of this twofold selection,
but to admit so much is to admit a good
deal; it is to admit that not all epochs are
equally available for the language of art,
and that though we exist in our own time,
it may be the part of wisdom and good
taste to derive our artistic speech from
another period. When Molière’s hero
pronounces his scorn of artificial verse and
contrasts with it an old song of the people,
he is rejecting a fashion that was contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
and temporary for one that was
lasting. When Homer wrote of ancient
Troy, or when Æneas sang the founding
of Rome, either poet was choosing the date
of his story with the same taste with which
he selected his theme, or selected the words
of which to make his lines; he was choosing
what the race after long reflection had
realized was dignified, noble and true in
feeling. The poet, whoever he was, that
left us the <cite>Song of Roland</cite>, no doubt was
expressing a sentiment toward France
which flourished in his own day, and which
may have been very foreign to the feelings
of the original Roland; as in the other
instances, the old story had to be changed
and expurgated to make it altogether the
vehicle of contemporary experience; yet
he was right in taking the great figure of
Roland for the outer clothing or language
of his emotions, since heroic sentiments
had already connected themselves with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Charlemagne’s peer, as they had not yet
with William of Normandy, nor with his
immediate predecessors. In English history
there have been efficient and picturesque
rulers in plenty, yet the poets were
right who have retold their national epics
in the story of Arthur rather than in the
biographies of Alfred or Edward I or
Cromwell; for the Arthurian legend as the
race has chosen to remember it is of richer
fabric emotionally and of a simpler structure
than any nearer and more actual history
could well be. Theodore Roosevelt,
for all we know, may have been a greater
man than Cromwell, and time may make
him seem more significant, but if the poet
wishes to say things about the strenuous
life, he had better say them now through
the image of Cromwell, about whom our
emotions are more classified; better still
if he says them through the image of King
Arthur, who much more than Cromwell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
has become a precise symbol in the imagination.
Arthur was to have been the hero
of Milton’s epic—at least, Milton considered
him for a possible hero but discarded
him in favor, not of Cromwell or Hampden,
but of Adam; and again the choice
was wise, since Adam is still an image
more universally understood than any of
Milton’s contemporaries, and we know
what we are expected to feel when we hear
his story.</p>

<p>To say then that in writing, even when
our purpose is art and not satire, we
should express ourselves in terms of the
life about us, is to lay down a formula
which has been contradicted in practise by
the influential writers of the world. To
find a language already wide-spread and
therefore intelligible, the artist will always
draw to some extent on the past, even
though he does so unconsciously, and how
far he goes back into the past will depend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
on what it is he wants to express.
In <cite>Henry Esmond</cite>, Thackeray used the
age of Marlborough to express a flavor of
romance that could not be said in life of a
later date. But when he had satire for his
purpose, as in <cite>Vanity Fair</cite>, he chose a
period comparatively modern. It is but
fair to observe, however, that Thackeray
follows this principle with very uncertain
skill. The period he chose for his great
satire was somewhat more remote than for
<cite>Pendennis</cite> or <cite>The Newcomes</cite>, where his
purpose was less obviously and exclusively
moral; the resulting effect in each case
is somewhat peculiar, since most of us,
unless we count up the dates, perhaps
get the impression that <cite>Vanity Fair</cite> was
the contemporary book. In one sense
it makes little difference, and we might
use the illustration to indicate that it is
the method of treatment, rather than the
life portrayed, that will make a book seem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
contemporary. But we are left to wonder
also whether Thackeray did not intend
<cite>Vanity Fair</cite> to be more satirical in its effect
than it actually is, and <cite>The Newcomes</cite>
to be less so. Did the great but easy-going
artist make here a careless choice of
the time for his story?</p>

<p>Even the writers who seem now to have
been most contemporary were really not
so; what seems contemporary in them are
eternal aspects of life, which even in their
day were old. We sometimes doubt the
value of those scholarly labors which
search out for us the sources, so-called,
of the great poets, the residuum of earlier
times which they adapted to express their
genius; but these labors would be justified
sufficiently by the answer they give to
those who think that art speaks through
contemporary life. They think that we
should look in our heart and write, as Sidney
did, or return directly to nature, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
did Wordsworth, forgetting that when
Sidney looked in his heart to write, he
wrote some masterly translations and
paraphrases of earlier Italian or French
poems, and that when Wordsworth drew
on his personal experience, as in the immortal
lines to the Cuckoo, he recast an
earlier fine poem by Michael Bruce. The
believers in the contemporary urge us to
paint the record of our own times as immediately
as Chaucer wove his neighbors
into the tapestry of the Canterbury Tales;
they do not know how many versions there
were of the famous tales before Chaucer
shaped them to his own purposes. Indeed,
so much of the past has gone into all that
we now are or say or do, that the attempt
to detach ourselves from the best that has
gone before is in a way a denial of contemporary
character to our own times, or
to any other period; for the quality of civilization
in 1923 which distinguishes it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
from civilization in 1823 is the gift, for
good or evil, of the hundred years in between;
and to be contemporary with any
moment in history is to be aware of all the
past that still is articulate in that moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>If a writer fails to use the past as the
language with which to express his present,
the reason may be that he does not
know the past, or that he has theoretical
objections to using it so, even though the
great writers have followed no other
method. But this reason is rarely the
true one. Today as at other times any
sincere writer will be interested in the
great examples of his art, and will find
them out, and probably the same instincts
will eventually show themselves in his
work as in the work of his predecessors.
Undoubtedly there are poets and novelists
today who through a mistaken cult
of the natural are striving for a strictly
contemporary utterance—rejecting, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
is, all that they can recognize in our speech
as having a history. If their scholarship
were more complete, they would have to
reject even the meagre vocabulary of
word, image and legend they are now content
to use. But the writer who willingly
would avail himself of the full inheritance
in his art finds himself limited perhaps for
another reason—he finds that his readers
do not know the past, that many of them
cultivate an ignorance of it, and that,
therefore, if he uses it to speak with, he
may not be understood. It is part of the
discipline which every art imposes on those
who practise it, that they must speak in
terms intelligible to their audience. It remains
to ask, of course, who are the audience?
and the writer, if he is sufficiently
courageous, stubborn, or hopeful, may
choose to address a more intelligent audience
than he finds in his day, an audience
who he thinks will at last recover the traditional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
tongue in which he speaks, and
for whom it will be worth his while to wait.
This may seem to some of us the only way
out, but we know it is a precarious way.
Such a brilliant belated justification came
to the Greek classics at the Renaissance;
it has come in music to such a giant as
Bach, who was, as we say, ahead of his own
day; but to expect it to come to us merely
because our contemporaries do not appreciate
us is entirely too obvious a self-flattery.
The sane artist will rather do his
best to say what he has to say in language
his day understands, and he will try also
to encourage his audience in the recovery
of a larger language, so that he may say
more to them.</p>

<p>This question whether the reader has
sufficient command of the inherited language
of literature is always an acute
one for the author; the lasting successes
in literature have been made at those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
moments when a knowledge of the past
was wide-spread, and the audience were
as familiar with the older literature as
the writers were. Historical as Virgil
seems to us in the <cite>Æneid</cite>, almost antiquarian,
he offered to his first readers
nothing they were not familiar with,
and little that would not immediately
kindle an emotion. In one sense then
he may be said to have spoken in a contemporary
language. But neither he nor
his audience would have understood the
doctrine that art becomes great by being
contemporary, and that it becomes contemporary
by discrediting the past. “To
have great poets, there must be great audiences
too”, said Whitman, and here, as
elsewhere, we are coming to realize, he
got at the permanent truth of the matter.
For it is a sound observation of literary
historians that a country exercises its impulses
toward art, in any period, as much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
by what it reads of the older books as by
what it writes; the two activities must go
together if the contemporary great writer
is to get a competent hearing, and they
must be studied together if we are to estimate
justly the culture of an epoch. In
what was produced, some decades of the
eighteenth century in England look to us
destitute of poetry, but in those very moments
Spenser, Shakespeare and Milton
were widely loved, and enjoyed perhaps a
more humane and significant treatment
from the critics than they have often had
since. The weakness of contemporary
poetry in Addison’s time, in Warton’s
and Gray’s, was not that they knew the
elder masters, but that their practise departed
so widely from them and became
so contemporary. The revival in the romantic
age was brought about by rejecting
the kind of art the early eighteenth
century wrote, and by building on the still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
earlier art the eighteenth century had the
wisdom to love.</p>

<p>In our day and in our land the question
of the audience is peculiarly acute, and
it has been rendered more so by the intentional
efforts of those who believe that
literature should be contemporary. Even
without those efforts we, who come from
many countries, with different race memories
and with the legacy of different cultures,
should have had difficulty enough
to achieve a common language adequately
rich in the best things of the past and
welded into some continuity with our
American future. If we write in those
terms which to an Italian would be emotional,
we shall hardly stir the pulses of
a Scotchman or a Slav, and if we waken
the race-memories of the Spanish or the
French, we may leave quite cold the Dutch
in Pennsylvania or the Swede in Minnesota.
Our first hope, to which some of us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
still desperately cling, is that we may lose
no one of these racial inheritances, but that
by a jealous conserving and study of each
of them, and by teaching them all to our
children, we may build up one of the
richest cultures that the accidents of migration
have ever permitted the race to
compose. The literature of America in
a thousand years would carry in its majestic
overtones the essential beauty of all
the civilizations that have made their entry
through our ports, the essential beauty too
of the wonderful Indian civilizations
which our European coming dispossessed,
and above these overtones, perhaps, the
far-off suggestions of the Greek and
Roman worlds and the immemorial East.</p>

<p>But this hope, whether or not it could
be realized, is so far as we can see at present
a fantastic dream; our progress toward
it has been slight—better, to be
frank, we have made no progress, rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
we have lost ground. There is less general
culture of that sort in the United States
now than there was fifty years ago. It has
seemed wise to many of us, therefore, to
moderate our hopes, and to aim at mastering,
not all our heritages in common, but
at least one tradition, and that the tradition
of this country from the revolution
till the present day. Such a program
might be carried out in our schools—not
in the colleges, since only a fraction of the
country’s youth gets to college, but in
those early school years through which all
the boys and girls may reasonably be expected
to pass; and there would be nothing
illogical in burdening the schools with the
task, for the training of a common consciousness,
cultural or otherwise, in a land
of immigrants is the chief problem of elementary
education. We thought, then,
that we might all absorb our own past and
the few decades that preceded our coming,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
so that hereafter the spokesmen of the nation,
poets, dramatists, preachers, statesmen,
might at least touch some common
chords in us all by naming those who built
up the opportunities we enjoy. This program
is still in force in other departments
of study than literature, but the teachers
of literature have been largely won over to
the cult of the contemporary; so far from
building up in the land a great audience
for the great poets to sing to, many energetic
teachers of literature are persuading
these children, if persuasion is necessary,
to read only books of the day, about things
of the day, and by inference to neglect as
really negligible anything written yesterday
or written about other times and other
problems than ours. Our dream of a cosmopolitan
culture has shrunk in practise
to an educational discipline which will
make us more insular and provincial than
we are already, more selfish, more contemptuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
of other times and of other
peoples, and still further disinherited from
great art.</p>

<p>The movement began a few years ago
in a protest against the narrow choice of
books permitted by the requirements for
entrance to college. Some of the schools
thought they could do their best work if
their teachers—and their pupils—could
select the books for this arduous study;
there could be some wise consulting of
taste, some adaptation to special temperaments.
So long as the choice was still to
be made from books of recognized merit,
it was unreasonable to deny this request.
But the trend toward the contemporary
developed quickly; if we consulted the
taste and the temperament of our students,
the children of many racial traditions,
we found that few of the older writers
were easy for them to understand; the
difficulty of bridging over the gap between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
traditions was too great for many of our
teachers to solve, or perhaps they themselves
were not at home in the tradition
either of the books or of the students; and
the most graceful form of surrender was
to study only what was easy for everybody.
The process was paralleled in society
outside of the schoolroom, in the
change in ideals and in competence which
overtook professed criticism in our reviews;
but the heart of the matter was
and still is in the centers of education.</p>

<p>A teacher of English in New York City
recently presented the case for contemporary
literature vs. the classics, in some
such argument as this: When she was in
college, she said, the faculty took such an
inhospitable view of the world about them
that only one author, of all those they
studied in literature classes, was still alive
when they studied his books. She and her
fellow students felt somehow cramped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
and cheated, not to be studying more
books of which the authors were still living.
In other words, whereas the critics
in Mr. Shaw’s play could not judge the
work till they knew who wrote it, these
lovers of the contemporary could not estimate
a book till they knew whether the author
was in or out of the graveyard. In
these better days, the teacher went on to
say, she and her colleagues allow for the
natural desire of their students to read
what is written at the moment—a life of a
prominent man like Theodore Roosevelt,
the work of a columnist in the daily press,
the popular plays, the most talked-of
novels. Such reading, she explained, gives
opportunity for ethical or social or political
discussion in class; she meant, it
seems, that you can argue whether the
Middle West was fairly portrayed, and if
so, what should be done to cure it, or
whether we should have gone into the war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
at all, or if so, what should have been done
to make the lot of the private easier, and
establish the officer on a less privileged
plane. Out of this open discussion of
spontaneous interest in current events,
will come, she thought, a finer taste for
the best in art.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the training, such
as it is, which is to produce this finer taste
is a training not in art at all, but in Americanization,
if you choose to call it so, in
sociology or in politics. These purposes
are good in their place, but if they usurp
the classroom where literature as an art
should be taught, we need expect no aid
from the schools in training us to a common
culture, not at least so far as the word
applies to poetry, to romance, to the
drama, to the novel. We might Americanize
ourselves in literature by reading
our older poets—three of them, Whitman,
Poe and Emerson, of influence in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
whole world today; we might read our
elder novelists, two of whom, Cooper and
Hawthorne, at their best were among the
prose-poets of the nineteenth century; or
we might read Parkman, an historian not
likely to be surpassed for the beauty of his
spirit, for the solidity of his method, and
for the romantic charm of his subject, by
any who will hereafter write about this
land. We might read Lincoln, about
whom we talk so much, and we might
profitably read Jefferson and Hamilton.
We might even discover the charm of the
colonial records, north and south, and the
heroic poetry of our frontier, as it pushed
through wilderness and across plain and
canyon, to face at last the Orient again
and our inscrutable future. This kind of
Americanization would produce class discussion
of some dignity, even though it
had nothing to do immediately with the
art of literature, for it would give us, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
only a sense of our common destiny, but
an escape from our own circumstances
into other days and other minds, and it
would cultivate the sympathy and the
imagination once thought to be the fruit of
literary study. But to discuss always and
exclusively only what is under our own
noses, to study a life of Mr. Roosevelt not
because it is a great biography but because
it is about Mr. Roosevelt, and to study
novels not because they are good novels,
but because they are about us, is to find
ourselves in the end just where we were
in the beginning, with our prejudices more
firmly rooted and our skin a bit thicker
to any joy or sorrow in the world not
our own. As for the ability to understand
great writing when it comes to us, we
have learned only this, that since Mr.
Roosevelt lived nearer our day than Dr.
Johnson, the biography of him is a better
biography and a more interesting one than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Boswell could write, and we need not read
Boswell; and since Main Street is nearer
to us than Salem, Mr. Lewis is a greater
novelist than Hawthorne, and we need not
read Hawthorne. Enough to know that
the whole contains the part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Well, then, says the teacher of current
literature, there never can be any great
books, for you approve of nothing contemporary,
and every book, unfortunately,
has to be written in its own time. Yes,
in a sense, anything you write, on however
remote a subject, will be of your time
and will represent it; Walter Pater was
expressing one phase of Victorian England
when he wrote <cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite>.
But the artist hopes to appeal to more
than the present generation; even the most
contemporary of our contemporaries, who
read no books of which the authors are not
living, cherish some ambition to have their
own works read after they themselves are
gone. And since the fame of a book depends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
on its ability to meet the interest of
readers over a long period of time, the life
of our works will depend on two things—on
our gift for selecting the matter which
is permanently interesting to men, and
on the willingness or unwillingness of any
generation to be interested in the same
things as its predecessors. If readers are
now brought up to neglect as a matter of
course any works of literature that once
were loved, there will be no fame for any
one hereafter, and no masters of the art,
but only in each publishing season a nine
days’ wonder. But if human nature still
asserts its primal interests, in spite of mistaken
teaching, and continues to like in
the long run the same things that have
been loved in the past, then the writer will
finally be reckoned great who answers, not
the mood of his hour, but the spirit of those
constant demands. He will get his inspiration
from life as he knows it; he will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
express it in an eternal form, as we say—at
least in a form so durable that instead
of our understanding his work through
the incident that inspired it, we shall know
of the incident through the work. Molière
has so immortalized one moment of his
times in his <cite>Précieuses Ridicules</cite>; without
the play, would we know much of the temporary
affectation? And to be quite
frank, has not something died in the play,
along with what was contemporary in it,
so that we enjoy it now with an historical
effort not needed to be at home, let us say,
with Falstaff? Tennyson really immortalized
the Charge of the Light Brigade,
for the incident on so many grounds has
since proved regrettable that we should
be glad to forget it, but for the poem, and
we begin to be sorry that the poem is
anchored to so much that was transitory.
Our own civil war poet, Henry Howard
Brownell, true genius if we ever had one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
wrote his verses on the very scene, after
the fights he had passed through as
Farragut’s secretary on the flagship, and
the virulence of contemporary passion is
in his work forever, an embarrassing alloy.
But of the danger of being contemporary,
Dante is the great illustration. It is not
hard to see what an impact his great poem
must have made on his first hearers, it was
so immediate in its reference to persons,
places, incidents, crimes and disasters
which Florence, Rome and Italy well
knew; but what an effort it is now to recover
all those allusions to the times, indeed
how impossible! We wrestle with
them, if at all, because the greatness of
the poem bears up their leaden weight;
and the poem is great for what is least
contemporary in it, for the vision which
Dante drew from his masters, and which
he handed on to the future in images of
the past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>The impulse to be contemporary is in
our time, and perhaps always was, an impulse
to tell the news. This impulse is
felt perhaps in all the arts, but most in
books and in the theatre, less in music,
still less in painting, and least in architecture
and sculpture. From these last we
can learn, if we need a reminder, what are
the conditions of enduring art, and what,
in contrast to popularity, is fame. Sculpture
and architecture, from the substantial
nature of their medium, must submit
to be looked at more than once, to be lived
with, finally to be judged by the good
opinions of many men over a long period
of time; and a good opinion of such work,
so lived with, will depend less on the first
impression than on habitual contact. For
such work popularity is difficult, if not
impossible. A book about the war may be
a popular book; the Farragut statue in
Madison Square is not a popular statue.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
What statue is popular? It can have only
the better kind of success, if any; like the
Farragut, it can be famous, loved and
returned to over an indefinite length of
time. For we can read a book once and
throw it aside, or hear music or see a play
but once, and then criticize it; it lies entirely
in our choice whether we shall read
or hear twice. How different our criticism
would be if it were based on at least
half a dozen readings and hearings! But
the bronze and the building are not easily
removed or ignored, and even the painting
has a good chance of being looked at more
than once. It is not surprising then that
the sculptor, like the architect or the
painter, attends to the conditions on which
fame is secured, since popularity is denied
him, and makes his appeal to revised judgments
and to second thoughts.</p>

<p>It would be a misfortune to seem to say
that the author who misses popularity is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
necessarily an artist, or that even temporary
success is not to be admired. But
in American letters we are beginning to
wonder why our great successes are so
transitory; why a writer who sells more
copies of his first book than did Thackeray
or Dickens, does not continue like them
to reach a large public with succeeding
books; and why he does not, like them,
continue to be read after he has ceased to
write. The explanation suggested is that
most American writers, not only today but
throughout the last twenty-five years,
have written as journalists—have put out
their material not as life but as news about
life, and the critics have discussed it as
news, and the readers have come to look
for the news in it, and for nothing else.
Some novelists still writing began their
work with successful stories of local color,
which we read in order to learn about
Louisiana or Pennsylvania or the Middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
West, and having got the information we
were looking for, we went elsewhere to
look into other novelties. It goes without
saying that in this process we readers have
done injustice to many a work of art; <cite>Old
Creole Days</cite> and <cite>Main Traveled Roads</cite>
have something for the permanent reader,
as well as for the news-seeker, and <cite>Trilby</cite>—to
speak of an English book—is still a
magnificent romance of friendship and
chivalry, though it expired of its own success
as a bulletin from the Latin Quarter
and a document in hypnotism.</p>

<p>At least, says again the lover of current
things, you must write in the language of
the hour. Some beauty is lost when the
poet does not speak in his native tongue,
or when we cannot read him in it. Well,
some languages are better than others;
Greek was a better language, more precise,
more varied, more forceful and more
colorful, than English or any of the modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
tongues. But all language changes,
as the works of art in language do not; in
literature we have this haunting paradox,
that through a temporary medium we can
build something imperishable. Much as
we may dislike literature in translation,
it is perhaps salutary to remember that
literary masterpieces must survive in
translation or not at all. In what language
were the parables spoken? If
Homer were not Homer still in English
or French or German, how much of
Homer would the world know? Some
bouquet of his own time is gone, but perhaps
we should not have liked it if it had
remained. At least we have kept what we
liked; we have kept what suited our spiritual
needs, we have loved Andromache
and Hector, and wondered in the old way
why such fine men as Achilles and Agamemnon
should quarrel, and have decided,
as all our fathers have done, that for so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
beautiful a woman as Helen to waste her
time on so mean a fellow as Paris, there
must have been queer influences at work.
To live in art in this timeless way, is to
satisfy what is eternal in ourselves; it is
to leave behind us the limitations of our
hour, our place, and our language. And
unless art is wide enough for us to live in
it so, we shall trifle with it only for an
hour, and without regret let it go the way
of other contemporary things.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CHARACTERS PROPER TO LITERATURE</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Our impulse might be to say that any
character at all is proper to literature,
or to any phase of literature, for we
have long ago discarded that convention
of ancient story which introduced the hero
and heroine always as nobly born, or if at
first they were not gentlefolk, yet in the
last chapter they were shown to be prince
and princess in disguise. Our leading
characters now may have whatever origin
God wills; the author does not interfere.
No longer do we reserve the peasant, the
poor or the ignorant for the foot of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
list of <i lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>, nor do we smuggle
them into the scene at resting moments,
for comic relief. Since human nature
is the subject of art, and since the
Almighty (we quote Lincoln for this)
showed us where to put the emphasis in
human nature, by creating common folk
in the vast majority, we have even followed
the example with an excess of enthusiasm,
until the elect are pretty well
put down from their former seat in literature,
and in their stead are the socially
humble and the mentally weak. For a
hundred years or more we have been pressing
this charitable revolution. Wordsworth,
though not the first to try it, first
won a considerable hearing in English
poetry for the beggar, the pedlar, the afflicted,
the half-witted—a hearing for
them, that is, as central figures in the
poems where they occur; and shortly
afterwards the novelists, on the irresistible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
tide of humanitarianism, invited not only
our attention but our admiration for persons
who hitherto had seemed obscure and
unfortunate. Dickens perhaps went too
far, we now feel; he demonstrated the
weakness of the gentry, and sent them to
the background of the story, where we are
willing enough they should remain, but he
also tried to endow the lower classes with
so much delicacy, tact, and spirit that his
leading persons seem to be gentry still,
masquerading in a temporary eclipse of
fortune, like the lost prince and princess
of the fairy tale. But he taught us how
to carry on his unfinished revolution; since
he stripped sentimentality, all that sort of
nonsense, from the gentry, we have known
at last how to strip it from the bourgeois.
Some of our novelists riddle the polite
world for us, others tell us the unflinching
truth about our middle classes. We have
no heroes; any character can get into our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
literature, if we may use him as a target
rather than worship him as a god.</p>

<p>It is too late to return, even if we desired
to do so, to the sentimental misreading
of social conditions against which our
modern realism, however grim, tries honestly
to protest, and there is a form of discourse
in which human frailties can properly
be discussed; social science or the
science of ethics would neither of them deserve
the name of science if we excluded
from their consideration any aspect of
human character or conduct—just as
medicine would fail in its office if we forbade
it to study any part or function of
the body. But it is not too late to ask ourselves
the difference between science and
art; between a story which represents our
physical actions with that conscience in
detail which would aid a medical diagnosis,
and a story through which Helen’s
body walks, a joy forever; between a record<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
of our neighbors just as they are, or
a bit meaner, and a picture of men and
women as we would gladly be. Anything
printed may be called literature, even last
year’s time-tables, but if we preserve in
the word an emphasis upon art rather than
upon information, we may ask after all
whether certain characters, or certain attitudes
toward character, are not essential
to art; or, putting it another way, we
may ask whether the type of character we
portray will not determine the kind of art
we produce, with or without our will, and
whether the kind of character we portray
will not finally classify our writing for
us as art or as social document.</p>

<p>To have our novel appraised as a social
document may seem to us a compliment,
and we may be glad to escape the equivocal
verdict that our picture of life is art.
The terms are unimportant and our prejudices
in words may be respected. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
fact remains that some books we are to
read many times, and permanently,
whereas others are for a season only, and
may be read but once; and books which
must serve us in ways so different would
seem to need certain special privileges of
method and material—they may even be
permitted certain varieties of emphasis not
usually found in life. The temporary
writing helps us on our way, and we ought
to have one honorable name for it all—newspapers,
telephone directory, time-tables,
all our telegrams and most of our
letters. We stop over them only for a
moment, in order to go about our business
more conveniently. But the other kind
of books will detain us forever, or will try
to—and this kind of literature is art; we
return thither for no information and for
no immediate aid in our daily affairs, but
rather to taste again an experience we enjoyed
before, to meet old friends, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
breathe an atmosphere which we crave,
and which is hard to find elsewhere.</p>

<p>If this distinction needs often to be
made between the literature which is information
and the literature which is art,
it is because both kinds of book use the
same medium, and speech is the commonest
of mediums. Painting or music escape
such a confusion, but writing is a slippery
craft, now running to a bare record or to
good advice, now drifting into a music of
words, articulating a beauty that seems
ageless and impersonal, and sometimes
doing a bit of all these things at once. In
daily conversation, when we talk of anything
in human interest, we use the same
words as literature is made of; what more
natural than to conclude that literature
therefore may deal with any subject we
talk of? We resent the suggestion that
art should be narrower than life itself.
Yet if we admit any difference at all between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
art and life, between literature and
our average conversations, between books
which give information and books which
give delight, and if art is the record of
that aspect of life we delight in not for
the moment but permanently, then art
is indeed narrower than life itself; outside
of it will remain the trivial things,
however likable, of our daily round,
which we forget gladly, so many other
pleasant and trivial things supplant
them; and outside of it also will remain
very important issues which we hope and
resolve shall be temporary—the grave
wrongs and errors which call not for
eternal contemplation but for reform.
Face to face with such problems, we often
feel that art is inadequate. What can
poetry do for the sick or the dying? What
solace is there in music or sculpture for
the wretchedly poor? The answer to such
questions is not in art but in conduct;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
death calls for fortitude, sickness must be
cured, poverty must be relieved; and if
books deal with such subjects, it is not for
a literary end, but to aid us in practical
remedies. Indeed, to have a literary ambition
as we contemplate another’s misery,
would seem possible only for a fiend; it is
in the merit of Mrs. Stowe’s story of
Uncle Tom that the book seems a protest
from the soul rather than a work of art. If
there are sins and misfortunes, it may be
necessary to spread the news, as though
the house were on fire, but if we really care
for our house we shall not linger to enjoy
the cadence of the thrilling call. On the
other hand, if we are to lose ourselves in
a book or a play, if we are to live in it
repeatedly, ourselves the hero, in love with
the heroine, and hating the villain, then
the book or play must give us an experience
in some sense better than the life
ordinarily available to us; who would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
waste a moment on Cleopatra in a book, if
he knew where to find her in the world?
Or perhaps in life she was less charming
than Plutarch said she was, or than Shakespeare
showed her to be; perhaps we
could not be drawn irresistibly to her
until the poet made her better than she
was—made her, that is, a character proper
for the literature which is to be enjoyed
as art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The effect of the excellence or the inferiority
of the character on the book was
long ago observed by Aristotle, when he
said that tragedy and the epic—that is,
all serious literature—will aim at representing
men as better than in actual life,
and that comedy and satire will represent
them as worse. In this second kind of
writing, he added, satire came first, and
it was Homer who laid down the principles
of comedy, by dramatizing the
ludicrous instead of composing personal
satire. This famous observation of the
ancient critic has been too often read as
doctrine, as though Aristotle were telling
us what should take place in literature,
whereas he is recording what actually does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
take place. If you wish to write a story or
a play in which the reader can lose himself
with delight, you must portray character
better than the reader, character which
in some degree satisfies and strengthens
his aspirations. If you wish the reader
to laugh at the world, or to scorn it, or
to feel the need of improving it, you portray
for him character in a condition inferior
to his estimate of himself; if you
wish him to profit by that wholesome self-observation
which we call the comic-spirit,
you mingle satire with tragedy—you show
him character which satisfies his aspirations,
so that he will identify himself with
it, and which at the same time is inferior
in some respects to what he would prefer
to be, so that he must laugh at himself.
He will have a tendency to save the day for
self-respect by laughing, not at himself,
but at human nature, and the universal
comic spirit will then have come to birth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
akin to both satire and tragedy, but more
nearly a dramatizing of the ludicrous, as
Aristotle said, than a scoring of personal
faults.</p>

<p>These principles, it goes without saying,
are not accepted by writers today;
the average author is not aware of them,
or if he is, he takes refuge in another remark
of Aristotle’s, that perhaps tragedy
was destined to develop into something
different from the type of poetry produced
by Æschylus, Sophocles and Euripides;
perhaps new principles, we say,
in the too familiar formula, are needed
for new material. So think many of our
poets and novelists who give us sordid and
wretched characters to contemplate, yet
invite us to feel toward them not the satiric
regret, but the old pity and terror
of noble tragedy. That the principles do
persist, however, very much as Aristotle
described them, is evidenced by the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
the readers still have with such
books; the authors argue their case, or
critics argue it for them, but common humanity
remains unconvinced that misery is
a proper subject for permanent contemplation.
In our age especially, when the
impulse to social good works is highly developed,
it is a curious paradox that
writers should expect us to associate in
art, as habitual companions, with types
of character which in real life we should
hasten to rescue and to change. It is
generous of the writers to suppose that
in a humane age the reader will be ready
to discern the heroic even beneath handicaps
and afflictions, and probably the
reader is thus ready, but the writers forget
that in any age, particularly in a
humane one, we do not like to contemplate,
in the permanence of art, heroic
character smothered beneath handicaps
and afflictions. And in justice to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
embarrassed reader it should be added
that often the character is not heroic at
all, and the only claim put forth for it
is that it might have been attractive if it
had not been smothered.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is the influence of Wordsworth
that still spreads this confusion in
our writing. The effect of many of his
best known poems has never been wholly
satisfactory, not even to his admirers; he
drew moral lessons from objects humble
or mean, and since his own interest was
in the moral lesson, he sometimes was
careless of the emotional appeal which the
object, left standing as it were in the
poem, might make on the reader. In one
sense he was not a nature-lover, though
he had recourse to nature for ethical wisdom;
it was only the wisdom he cared
about, and we have an unpleasant impression,
which perhaps does him injustice,
that when he had got a moral idea out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
of the primrose by the river’s brim, he
was through with the primrose for the
day. The same impression, unfortunately,
is made by his portrayal of humble
or mean characters. He obviously does
not identify his better fortunes with their
misery, nor does he enter dramatically or
imaginatively into their lives; he is content
to draw a moral from them, and the
reader, in his day and still in ours, is surprised
that misery in the picture, having
produced a moral, is promptly dropped
as though of no further concern. The
old leech-gatherer serves a purpose when
his courage against frightful odds cheers
up a moodish poet; the old beggar at the
door moves us to gratitude that another
man’s poverty keeps fresh in us our
springs of charity. Much good this does
the leech-gatherer or the beggar! And if
there is to be no help for them, their presence
is a bit disturbing in the background<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
of so much complacence. We wish there
were more tenderness in these poems that
talk so much of feeling. And when
Wordsworth deliberately sets out to enlist
our admiration for the heroic, we may find
ourselves facing such dumb human misery
as we have in <cite>Michael</cite>, the heroism of a
wrecked family and an abandoned farm.
With relief we turn to the passages in
the <cite>Prelude</cite> where the poet no longer
looks down benignly on the wretched, but
gives expression to the ideal life which he
himself desires to attain; there, where he
shows life better than it is, we can go with
him and lose ourselves in the vision.</p>

<p>It is our poets who chiefly defy Aristotle’s
wise warning, and try with Wordsworth
to convert into a theme for meditation
what is really a subject for philanthropy.
Our novelists tend more and
more to give us an inferior world, but not
for our admiration; we may smile at it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
or despise it, or try to cure it. This is
satire, an achievement in morals rather
than in art, and from the advertisements
on the book covers it is clear that the publisher
at least knows that the author is
revealing something medicinal, something
unpleasant but good for us. If we prefer
to write satires, we are at least achieving
our ambition. But the reader of the
American novel today, whether he reads
Mrs. Wharton, or Sinclair Lewis, or
whether he goes back to an earlier period
and reads W. D. Howells, is usually reading
about other people, rarely about himself;
he has noticed those faults in his
neighbors before. We have to go far back
in our literature to find a novel in which
the American future is implicit, a story
into which we can enter as into a world we
are glad is ours. Perhaps we must go back
as far as the <cite>Scarlet Letter</cite>, in which a
modern audacity of thought seems breaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
through an antique repression, and we
can identify profound speculations of our
own with the wisdom in Hester’s heart
or Arthur Dimmesdale’s. It has been
pointed out before how much Hawthorne
gained by making his chief characters
noble in the Greek way, tragic characters
better than in actual life; for the sin of
the woman and the minister was common
enough in the world among weak or vulgar
characters, and the impulse even in
Hawthorne’s time might well have been
to keep the story, for purposes of edification
or realism, in the low tone in which
it first occurred. But we cannot easily
take to heart the sins of people who are
obviously our inferiors; only the sins of
good people rouse in us tragic pity or
terror, for that is the kind of sin, if any,
we should commit. Hawthorne therefore
makes the minister a saint, and if Hester
is not a saint at the beginning, she is so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
at the end of her ordeal, and in the sufferings
of both our own heart has been wrung.
In the <cite>House of the Seven Gables</cite>, however,
the reader is a looker-on rather than
an actor, for the characters are not better
than life, their experience is therefore not
ours, and since we cannot cure their unhappiness,
we are sorry to watch it. In
that story our greatest romancer was on
the road toward the modern habit of
satire, a road which he had marked out for
us clearly enough in some of his early
sketches and tales.</p>

<p>The trend away from the literature of
art to the literature of satire is all the
more remarkable in our day because the
exigencies of satire compel the American
to deny wholesale his better self. There
might be some apparent reason for not
writing in the epic or the tragic tone if
in order to do so we had to assume virtues
we all knew we lacked; but why make a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
religion of writing satire, when to do so
we must conceal the few virtues we are
sure we have? Mr. Howells took it to
be his duty to tell the unvarnished truth
about human society as he knew it, but
you would not guess from his novels that
America ever produced so charming a
man as Mr. Howells and those literary
friends of his of whom, outside his novels,
he wrote lovingly. So Mr. Lewis pictures
America today—leaving out of the
picture the satirical criticism of America
in which he leads, and so Mrs. Wharton
shows us the narrower world of fashion,
with no one in it so gifted, so admirably
trained, as Mrs. Wharton. The best of
us is hard enough to express, as Rabbi
Ben Ezra knew, but how odd that we
prefer not to express it, whether difficult
or easy—that we deliberately conceal
what we have set our hearts on. We name
half a dozen characters from his plays in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
whom Shakespeare seems to be portraying
himself, and without too subtle a discrimination
we recognize ideals of our own
in all of them. Pendennis seems to be
Thackeray himself, and so seems Henry
Esmond and Clive Newcome, and we
flatter ourselves that the great novelist
incorporated in those portraits some of
our own best features. We—and Cervantes—are
incarnated in Don Quixote.</p>

<p>The contrast between information and
art in our books, and the tendency to stress
information with a moral bent, are both
thrown into sharper relief by the success
of American architecture in expressing
more and more a significant and lasting
beauty. Nothing might seem at first more
utilitarian than a building, and few things
in our country seem less permanent, we
have such a passion for altering. Yet art
has made its greatest progress with us in
architecture, and the stages of the progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
have been accompanied by just such
a selection and choice of subject as Aristotle’s
remarks about character would
imply. In our cities a genuine impulse
toward beauty began to show itself two
decades ago in shop-windows. Where
else should beauty appear but in the enterprises
we care most about? Since we were
lovers of business, we began to indicate
the beauty that business has in our eyes.
The shop-window ceased to be, what in
country hardware stores it still often is,
a place where samples of all the merchandise
were displayed, an order card from
which you could plan your purchases; it
became rather a scene of loveliness to contemplate
for its own sake, an attraction
to hold you rooted to the spot rather than
a stimulus to hurry you inside to buy.
Probably the shop-windows in our great
streets could not be justified now on a
purely economic basis; they have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
lifted into the realm of beauty and are
things to remember. But for this kind of
shop-window not every article the store
sells is “proper”, in the Aristotelian sense;
nothing ridiculous is shown, though ridiculous
things are bought and sold, nothing
trivial is shown, and nothing that discloses
too publicly the animal conditions in which
we lead our spiritual life. With a different
selection of articles which the store
for our convenience must sell, we might
have a comic window, the sight of which
would cause us to smile at ourselves, or
a satiric one, which would teach us to
laugh at our fellowman.</p>

<p>The buildings themselves, moreover,
have become beautiful by expressing what
we genuinely love to contemplate, and not
all kinds of buildings were proper to that
happy end. For mere sale and barter,
any shed in the market-place might serve,
but if we think of traffic in the large way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
that Ruskin suggested, as something potentially
heroic and noble, as a feeding of
the hungry and a clothing of the naked,
as a soldierly occupying of outposts
against poverty and wretchedness, as a
campaign of conquest against nature, and
as an exchange at last of spiritual hungers
and satisfactions among men, then our
houses of business should look like temples.
So they begin to look, and only a very
blind critic here and there still fails to see
that so they should look. With our love of
traffic goes our love of travel. In this
country travel is necessary, but it is also
an ideal. Any sort of railway station will
serve as a place to buy a ticket or board
a train, and until recently almost any kind
of barracks did serve for those purposes.
But the haphazard building could not express
our delight in travel, our enjoyment
of distance and speed and punctilious
arrivings and departings. The pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
casualness of the stage-coach and the road-side
inn does not really appeal to us, except
in exotic moments; our religion of
travel is uttered in the Pennsylvania Station
in New York, and in other such structures
fast rising throughout the country,
where the ritualistic atmosphere, produced
by carefully selected elements from
the buildings of antiquity, have little to
do with buying your ticket and a great
deal to do with the American spirit. We
breathe more freely as we enter them, and
enjoy the space and the height; our instinctive
comment is, “This is something
like!” as though some part of us had found
expression at last. And if this success in
architecture is as yet in the field of business
and travel, among public buildings,
the reason probably is that in those fields
we know what our aspirations are. In
ecclesiastical architecture, by way of contrast,
we are less clear. We feel that if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
the Woolworth building is so lovely, it is
but respectable to improve the appearance
of our churches, so we put up very wonderful
Gothic chapels and cathedrals—only
to find, perhaps, that they are a sort
of weight on our conscience rather than an
expression of our desires; we sometimes
try to cultivate the religion that produced
them, in order that so eloquent a language
may have more content in its words.</p>

<p>When we turn back from our architecture
to our books, we have the right to ask
why poetry and the novel address themselves
exclusively to what is in essence
satire, to the portrayal of us as worse than
we are, or with our aspirations left out;
why we as readers must be invited to
absorb mere information about ourselves
and our country; why we so seldom meet
in the pages offered to us the kind of men
and women we admire or ought to admire.
The arts all express the same thing, at any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
given moment, and if we are equally proficient
in them, they ought to achieve the
same grandeur and the same beauty.
Against the trivial and drab contents of
much of our poetry and the condescending
realism of much of our prose American
architecture now stands, a reproach and
an indictment; for the imaginative power
and sweep of our buildings is hardly discernible
in our books. The architects have
followed old wisdom, by making their
work ideal, better than life. The writers,
in a stubborn wrong-headedness, in defiance
of the readers’ psychology, portray
characters worse than in actual life, and
sometimes ask us to admire them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>To ask what characters are proper to
literature as an art, and to point out that
the character better than life will express
our ideals, and that the character worse
than life will invite our satire, is only to
raise in another way the old problems of
the universal as against the particular in
art, of the contemporary as against the
eternal. To be strictly personal is in the
end to be contemporary, and to be strictly
contemporary is to give, whether or not we
intend it, the effect of satire. If our picture
of life is to appeal to the reader, and
to many readers, as their own world, not
simply as their neighbors’ private house
into which they are prying, it must have
general human truth beyond what is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
strictly personal; and if it is to be read
with that sense of proprietorship by many
people over a stretch of time, it must not
limit itself to the peculiarities of any one
moment. It is true that the writer himself
lives but one life and is circumscribed
by time and place; if there were no such
thing as imagination he would only record
what he is, for the enlightenment of others
who are just like him; without imagination
he would not know of a better character
than his, or of a worse one, and we
should be spared the discipline of satire,
but at the price of art. The problem for
the writer, as for any other artist, is to
imagine the lives of other men, and the
lives that he and other men aspire to; his
business is to select from personal adventure
what is generally important, and to
see it against the background of universal
experience. Can any one imagine universal
experience? Perhaps not, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
nearer he comes to this difficult success
the more readers the world over will find
meaning in what he writes. To have a
personal career is no ground for conceit
in an artist—every one has as much; the
achievement is to state our experience so
that it is the experience of other people
too.</p>

<p>If we portray characters as better than
in actual life, there is no great difficulty
in making them seem universal; for it is
a radical gift in human conceit to fancy
that anything admirable or desirable has
a possible connection with ourselves. If
we do not at first discover what there is in
common between Romeo or Lincoln or
Achilles or General Lee and ourselves,
yet if we admire them we shall find the
resemblance, or try to create it. This is
the power of great imaginative art, that
the admirable things in it generate a kind
of universal emulation, and the story or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
statue which has been said to imitate
nature succeeds at last in persuading men
and women quite naturally to imitate it.
The power of a great book over human
conduct, even its influence at last upon
what might seem instinctive conduct, is
immeasurable. In the troubadour art of
love before Dante’s time, a true lover was
taught to turn pale at sight of his lady,
and at the unexpected sight of her to
faint; Dante loved that literature, and he
grew pale and fainted by second nature—just
as women once learned to blush at
certain things, and afterward learned
not to blush. How many lives were
affected, for good or evil, throughout
Europe and America, by the alluring
power of Byron’s heroes and heroines?
The poet, then, who represents character
as better than actual life, as possessing,
that is, something that we desire but have
not, has already made his hero universal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
and must some day accept the responsibility
of having dedicated his readers to
that general ideal. We may question
Byron on moral grounds by asserting that
his hero, after whom so many lives were
patterned, was really not deserving of any
imitation; just as an Oriental reformer
from India might tell us that the traffic
and travel of which our architecture is an
expression are both of them trivial enterprises,
mere distractions from the contemplative
ends of life. But such criticism
lies outside of art. To understand the
discipline which art imposes on us it is
enough to observe the kind of character
which does make an ideal effective in literature,
and the kind that precipitates us
into satire.</p>

<p>The real difficulty for the writer is not,
then, in generalizing the characters which
embody his ideal, and which therefore are
better than in actual life; what he will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
chiefly need for his success is to have the
ideals. But even with a consciousness of
deep aspiration he may wish to include in
the picture whole characters or parts of
character which are not what they should
be, and which yet are likable, even lovable;
and to give this double effect of inferiority
in some sense, together with
charm in some sense, is, it seems, very
difficult, for this is the effect of comedy,
and comedy is rare in any literature,
almost entirely absent from our own. If
you represent a character as worse than
in actual life, the condescending attitude
of the reader will not automatically draw
the portrait into some universal relation;
the writer must add something universally
admirable to the particular weakness we
look down on. Beatrice and Benedick
have exhausted their wit, and they are the
victims of a plot to marry them off to each
other; for such inferiority to their companions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
we cannot admire them. But
Shakespeare makes them both loyal to
their friends and generous in their delight
in life, and Beatrice has the good sense to
know innocence when she sees it; these
qualities we can identify with our own
virtues, and for these we admire the hero
and heroine. The poet further generalizes
both characters by reminding us through
their meditations that to fall in love is
not the work of reason, and that even the
wittiest scoffers succumb; here too we
gladly recognize our own experience. We
can therefore smile at the foibles of the
young people, partly because these foibles
are incident to all human nature, and
partly because, even with the foibles, we
like to identify ourselves in imagination
with the supplementary virtues. Socrates
was trying to persuade Aristophanes and
Agathon, in the gray dawn after the Symposium,
that the art of comedy and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
art of tragedy are the same; and so far
at least he was right, in that the universal
rendering which character must receive in
both, gives to the comic effect some of the
pity, though none of the terror, which
tragedy evokes. But Socrates did not say
that the art of tragedy is identical with
the art of satire.</p>

<p>When comedy is at its best—that is,
when we have made the inferior character
universal by showing that its faults are
natural, or by adding to it some general
virtues—we may indeed go further and
say that comedy produces perhaps the
terror as well as the pity of tragedy, and
that the two kinds of writing are, as Socrates
said, but one. The tragic or epic
hero, portrayed as better than in actual
life, may have faults, but so far from despising
him on that account, we may not
even smile; we like him so much that the
faults seem his misfortune. Moreover, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
we refer the weakness of the comic character
to nature itself, how can we be hard
on the individual? And if we add to the
faults positive and lovable virtues, will
not the comic character seem at last to be
tragic? In English drama Falstaff is perhaps
the prince of comic characters, so
vitally imagined that he lives on the stage
apart from any plot; he is a living person,
with no virtues at all, yet infinitely likable.
He can be played to make the groundlings
laugh, but most of us after we have
laughed taste profound tragedy in what
we have laughed at. He is almost majestic
in those moments of cowardice when
he portrays himself exactly as he is—when
he sees himself, as it were, from outside,
and points to those aspects of his
frailty which belong to mankind. An
actor might play the scenes on the battle-field
in <cite>Henry IV</cite> so as to inspire, not
laughter at the fat knight’s depravity, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
a pitiful and self-accusing silence. When
he finds the corpse of Sir Walter Blunt,
just slain—“Soft! who are you? Sir
Walter Blunt!—There’s Honour for
you! Here’s no vanity!... I have led
my ragamuffins where they are peppered;
there’s but three of my hundred and fifty
left alive, and they are for the town’s end,
to beg during life.... I like not such
grinning honour as Sir Walter hath.
Give me life; which if I can save, so; if
not, honour comes unlooked for.”</p>

<p>In French drama Molière brought
comedy to an excellence not matched, perhaps,
in any other literature, and no
imaginative writing is richer than his in
general ideas. We laugh at the amusing
situation, or delight in the frankly artificial
balancing of the plot, but on second
thoughts we fall silent, contemplating the
universal sweep of humanity, ourselves
included, which he has uncovered for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>The most obvious example for American
readers is in <cite>Tartuffe</cite>, where the unhappy
Elmire has difficulty in proving to her
husband Orgon that Tartuffe, whom he
greatly admires, is a treacherous friend
and is actually making love to her. She
finally admits Tartuffe to her room, having
first hidden her husband under the
table, from which he has promised to
emerge if Tartuffe should go beyond the
bounds of decency. Tartuffe, of course,
makes love in the clearest terms to his
friend’s wife, but Orgon remains concealed.
“Before we go any further”, says
Elmire, “just look down the hall to make
sure my husband isn’t coming.” “Why
worry about him?” says Tartuffe, “we can
lead him around by the nose.” Then
Orgon comes from under the table.
Where has the comedy brought us? Is it
not to a contemplation of our own vanity,
the source of the sense of honor in us all?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Are we laughing at Tartuffe and Orgon,
or are we thinking of ourselves?</p>

<p>Falstaff and Tartuffe illustrate the
generalizing of inferior characters by the
ascribing of their faults to human nature.
A good illustration of the comic character
which enlists our admiration and is
a genuine ideal is Huckleberry Finn. His
ignorance, his poverty, and his lack of
humor would seem to disqualify him for
any heroic career in literature, yet he is
a veritable hero, in the sense that we gladly
put ourselves in his point of view and return
again and again to live for an hour
or so in his experience. The reason is that
along with his inferior qualities he has
characteristics and he has a fortune which
seem better than ours; he is loyal to Tom
and the negro Jim, he has a simple faith
and zest in life, and he has exciting adventures
and gets romance out of scenes
we should otherwise find dull. He flatters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
us too by admiring people and things
which from his praise we know we should
treat satirically. To know what comedy
is, as opposed to satire, we have but to
read his story again and compare it with
any current indictment of the scene in
which his adventure was laid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>If the principles of tragedy, comedy
and satire are as implicit in our psychology
now as when Aristotle described them, and
if the principles of decorum, of art, and of
the timeless and the impersonal in art, are
as rooted in life as they are declared to be,
there might seem to be no great need to
preach them; the practice of literature
would disclose them in spite of our ignorance.
Try as we might to make a lovable
hero out of an inferior character, he would
still emerge a figure in satire or, if we
generalized his faults, a figure in comedy;
in serious literature, only a character
better than in real life would give satisfaction.
Though we do not doubt that the
principles of art will thus be rediscovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
pragmatically by the unescapable discipline
of literature, yet it is something of
a pity to go through such lengths of experiment
in order to find out what was
known before. And the great danger in
our country is that we may not push the
experiment to the tedious but profitable
end at which sound knowledge awaits us;
we may grow weary of the discipline, and
take refuge in parody or in sentimentality.
These two avenues of escape from the
problem have cursed American literature
before, and signs are not wanting that
they now are the temptations of those
who yesterday were our “new” writers and
promised brave things. Face to face with
characters worse than in actual life, we
may find our own satiric attitude monotonous,
but to handle such material otherwise
than satirically, we must master the
art of comedy, and comedy is an art too
difficult. What Bret Harte and Riley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
and Eugene Field did in such circumstances
was to obscure the meanness of the
subject by sentimentality, instead of
illuminating it by the comic spirit. Spoon
River has been celebrated before, though
we may not have recognized the subject
with the old sentimental surface removed;
much of our contemporary satire has been
the kind of surgical operation necessary
to separate the American reader from the
sentimentality which in his heart he likes.
Since it is in his heart, he may express it
again quite shamelessly, this time as a protest
against too much satire, and we may
have another welter of old oaken buckets
and old swimming holes and little boy
blues—the literature that provides the
satisfaction of a good cry, without the
over-exertion of tragic pity or terror. Already
we have again the familiar and
dilettante essay, the imitation of eighteenth-century
style, even in newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
columns, the interminable parodies of
Horace, which in this country have been
the advance signals of the sentimental
wave.</p>

<p>We can but hope that the signs may
prove deceptive, and that literature in
America will not wait much longer for the
characters and subjects proper to it, and
proper to the dramatic hour we live in—characters
and subjects expressing that
better part of us which has given our land
its direction and its power, and expressing
also that other world of the spirit
which man builds for elbow-room to exercise
his genuine ideals in, and carries it
around with him, and sets it up to be a
tabernacle in the wilderness of this natural
world.</p>
